On a small cluster of islands surrounded by a vengeful sea, the 5 races struggle to survive.
Active volcanoes, relentless cold, and beast-filled woods press against civilization. Gods and
their champions walk the land, their whims unpredictable and often violent. 

Amidst this chaos, the Tournament reigns. Freedom, wealth, and fame await those brave enough
to venture past their town's walls. The strong draw supernatural power from their devotion to
an ideal - any ideal. The weak... die.

Welcome to Yosai.

# Inspiration
Yosai is a world I've created for the stories I write. It's inspired by my time spent living
in Tokyo and traveling around Japan. It also embodies the themes and philosophies I ponder in
real life.

If you like anime, thought experiments, or the Japanese aesthetic (Zen, Shinto, wabi-sabi, etc.)
then you'll like the stories I write.

I you want to read more about the inspirations behind my stories, check out the [Principles]({{"/principles/" | relative_url }}).

# A writer's journey
I'm a new writer. I'm still learning the craft, finding my creative voice, and building a following.

You'll see experimental stories trying wildly different styles and tones. I'll ask for feedback
that shapes who I write about, what events unfold, and how I tell the stories you read. In short,
it'll be an interactive, iterative, all-access sort of relationship. No blindly waiting for 8 years
to see what comes out next. It should be pretty cool.

And yes, that means you'll read some bad stories from time to time.

If you want a current snapshot of what's going on in my current writing world, check out [The Process]({{"/process/" | relative_url }}).

# Housekeeping
You can see a full listing of everything I've written in [The Compendium]({{"/compendium/" | relative_url }}). If you want updates as I publish
new things, [join the mailing list](http://eepurl.com/ggSWZD){:target="_blank"} or [follow via RSS]({{ "/feed.xml" | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}. I promise I won't send you anything I wouldn't want to read myself.

Phew! All that out of the way, why don't I shut up and let the writing do the talking? Without further ado,
I present to you my latest story...
