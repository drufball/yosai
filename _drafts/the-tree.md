# Beginning at the end
Osoro Kidani sat on a large stone, staring at a soft, mossy patch next to the river. The air was crisp but the sun was high and bright, warming him slowly. The occasional gust, cutting through the valley on its way out the other side, pulled the hard-earned heat from him with greedy fingers, leaving him shivering as he waited for the sun to warm him again. 

He knew he should move. The black pines along the Eastern slope were in need of new supports. He would need to make a decision soon about how he wanted to shape them further. With the sun so clear in the sky, he really ought to see to some of the more exposed mosses. They were such fragile things.

The season of Chinami's Rebirth was just beginning. The river raged, swollen with snowmelt from the mountains above, announcing the changing of seasons with forceful pride. Osoro smiled for a moment, reminded of Yuko. She loved the river during Rebirth. Osoro preferred the more delicate blossoming of his plants. The gentle spread of green as mosses reclaimed the hillside from the snows. The coyness of the cherry blossoms, their buds peaking before they stepped fully into the sun.

Osoro sat for a moment longer, feeling the heat emanating from the hard rock beneath him. He let out a shaky sigh and pushed himself off the rock, brushing dirt from his hands. He was tall, with slender limbs and delicate features. Because it was nearly Rebirth, the dull ochre of his skin was shifting to a verdant green. The vines and leaves that sprouted from his head like hair were returning to life. 

He took one final look at the moss beside the river before turning his back towards the boisterous waters. Well-manicured woods sprawled before him. The rough-barked pines twisted intricately, held aloft by stilts of sturdy bamboo. Stone pathways crawled between the trees, seeking out the shaded groves and windswept viewpoints that Osoro cherished.

On a nearby tree, a small white-and-black mottled bird stared down at Osoro, its head cocked sideways. He felt a questing sense of curiosity from the bird, plucking at his mind. Osoro looked up at the bird, eyes closed in a smile. "I'll head to the Eastern grove, I think. Perhaps you could check the mosses along the riverbank? I'm sorry to be a bother, Bird. Normally Yuko would check but we'll just have to make do until she returns." 

Bird chirped and took off from the branch. Osoro called after as is fluttered towards the water's edge. "Oh! Please do land gently!"

Osoro passed the rest of the day pleasantly. He checked on the black pines, further up the mountainside. They were coming along nicely. Perhaps another 10 or 15 years and their shapes would be where he wanted them. Not too long. He was a Keeper after all.

He checked in a couple times with Bird. Sharing the creature's sight long enough to note the dryer patches and ensure that she wasn't rooting around in the delicate mosses for worms. She was incorrigible. Osoro would sleep easier when Yuko returned. Bird was better behaved when Yuko was there to discipline.

On his way back from the higher slopes of the valley, Osoro came across Bear and Monkey. Bear worked to push a large boulder across a clearing. Over 10 feet at the shoulder, Bear often took care of the more physically strenuous tasks around the forest. 

Osoro had asked her to move the rock further into the shade so that it caught a more gentle sunlight. He had plans for a wonderful sea-blue lichen that would compliment the clearing marvelously. 

A deep furrow in the ground marked the path of the boulder. Monkey was supposed to be filling and smoothing the furrow. Instead he slept atop the boulder Bear was pushing. When Monkey saw Osoro approaching, he sniffed in surprise and winked out of sight, turning invisible. Osoro shook his head and continued back towards the river.

Yuko had left her three familiars behind to help Osoro care for the forest. He hoped that she wouldn't need them or their abilities in the trials she faced.

Yuko was a spark, a shifter who could do more than just take on the form of animals within her domain. Just as adepts could shape the magic they used, sparks could alter and enhance the creatures to which they were bound, imbuing them with powers. 

Osoro was grateful for Yuko's abilities. They were a marvelous gift. When they weren't causing problems, at least. Osoro reminded himself that those problems were nearly over. When Yuko returned a Champion, the gods could no longer hunt her.

The sun was setting as the hills began to flatten. Osoro took the long path home, the one that veered towards the river before continuing on to the secluded grove where he and Yuko lived. Just one more check to see that the spot remained clear. He knew he was being over-anxious as always, but the peace of mind would help him sleep better. 

Osoro rounded a corner and the river came into view. His eyes immediately jumped to the familiar spot. The spot that had been empty every day of the last three weeks. The spot that now had a sapling sprouting at its center. 

Osoro rushed forward, unable to believe his eyes. The sapling was small, but growing visibly. Leaves opened tentatively along the branches, like a newborn deer uncertain of the legs beneath it. "Oh." Osoro dropped to his knees, crushing the fragile moss beneath him. He reached for the small tree before him, his hands shaking as they hesitated, outstretched.

Then Osoro wept.
