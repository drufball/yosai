# Beginning at the end
Osoro Kidani sat on a large stone, staring at a soft, mossy patch next to the river. The air was crisp but the sun was high and bright, warming him slowly. The occasional gust, cutting through the valley on its way out the other side, pulled the hard-earned heat from him with greedy fingers, leaving him shivering as he waited for the sun to warm him again. 

He knew he should move. The black pines along the Eastern slope were in need of new supports. He would need to make a decision soon about how he wanted to shape them further. With the sun so clear in the sky, he really ought to see to some of the more exposed mosses. They were such fragile things.

Chinami's Rebirth was just beginning. The river raged, swollen with snowmelt from the mountains above, announcing the changing of seasons with forceful pride. Osoro smiled for a moment, reminded of Yuko. She loved the river during Rebirth. Osoro preferred the more subtle blossoming of his plants. The gentle spread of green as mosses reclaimed the hillside from the snows. The coyness of the cherry blossoms, their buds peaking before they stepped fully into the sun.

Osoro sat for a moment longer, feeling the heat emanating from the hard rock beneath him. He let out a shaky sigh and pushed himself off the rock, brushing dirt from his hands. He was tall, with slender limbs and delicate features. Because it was nearly Rebirth, the dull ochre of his skin was shifting to a verdant green. The vines and leaves that sprouted from his head like hair were returning to life. 

He took one final look at the moss beside the river before turning his back on the boisterous waters. Well-manicured woods sprawled before him. The rough-barked pines twisted intricately, held aloft by stilts of sturdy bamboo. Stone pathways crawled between the trees, seeking out the shaded groves and windswept viewpoints that Osoro cherished.

On a nearby tree, a small white-and-black mottled bird stared down at Osoro, its head cocked sideways. He felt a questing sense of curiosity from the bird, plucking at his mind. Osoro looked up at the bird, eyes closed in a smile. "I'll head to the Eastern grove, I think. Perhaps you could check the mosses along the riverbank? I'm sorry to be a bother, Bird. Normally Yuko would check but we'll just have to make do until she returns." 

Bird chirped and took off from the branch. Osoro called after as is fluttered towards the water's edge. "Oh! Please do land gently!"

Osoro passed the rest of the day pleasantly. He checked on the black pines, further up the mountainside. They were coming along nicely. Perhaps another 10 or 15 years and their shapes would be where he wanted them. Not too long. He was a Keeper after all.

He checked in a couple times with Bird. Sharing the creature's sight long enough to note the dryer patches and ensure that she wasn't rooting around in the delicate mosses for worms. She was incorrigible. Osoro would sleep easier when Yuko returned. Bird was better behaved when Yuko was there to discipline.

On his way back from the higher slopes of the valley, Osoro came across Bear and Monkey. Bear worked to push a large boulder across a clearing. Over 10 feet at the shoulder, Bear often took care of the more physically strenuous tasks around the forest. Osoro had asked her to move the rock further into the shade so that it caught a more gentle sunlight. He had plans for a wonderful sea-blue lichen that would compliment the clearing marvelously. 

A deep furrow in the ground marked the path of the boulder. Monkey was supposed to be filling and smoothing the furrow. Instead he slept atop the boulder Bear was pushing. When Monkey saw Osoro approaching, he sniffed in surprise and winked out of sight, turning invisible. Osoro shook his head and continued back towards the river.

Yuko had left her three familiars behind to help Osoro care for the forest. He hoped that she wouldn't need them or their abilities in the trials she faced.

Yuko was a spark, a shifter who could do more than just take on the form of animals within her domain. Just as adepts could shape the magic they used, sparks could alter and enhance the creatures to which they were bound, imbuing them with powers. 

Osoro was grateful for Yuko's abilities. They were a marvelous gift. When they weren't causing problems, at least. 

Osoro reminded himself that those problems were nearly over. When Yuko returned a Champion, the gods could no longer hunt her.

The sun was setting as the Osoro reached the bottom of the hills. He took the long path home, the one that veered towards the river before continuing on to the secluded grove where he and Yuko lived. Just one more check to see that the spot remained clear. The peace of mind would help him sleep better. 

Osoro rounded a corner and the river came into view. His eyes immediately jumped to the familiar spot. The spot that had been empty every day of the last three weeks. 

The spot that now had a sapling sprouting at its center. 

Osoro rushed forward, unable to believe his eyes. The sapling was small, but growing visibly. Leaves opened tentatively along the branches, like a newborn deer uncertain of the legs beneath it. "Oh." Osoro dropped to his knees, crushing the fragile moss beneath him. He reached for the small tree before him, his hands shaking as they hesitated, outstretched.

Then Osoro wept.

# First Contact
Osoro stood, placing his hands on his hips and arching his back as he stretched. The river's cool waters swirled around his legs while the warm sun beat against his bared back. Emiko's Revel was the best time for working on the water features. Osoro looked at the newly-built bridge with pride. It formed a semi-circle, arcing over the river like a leaping deer. 

The bridge was young and raw, out of place amongst the stately elegance of the surrounding forest. But time would fix that. The wind and the sun would weather the wood. Mosses would reclaim the churned earth on either side. Soon it would be at home with its new surroundings.

"What do you think, Tree?" Osoro waded from the waters, making his way towards the beech tree growing near the river. Though it's growth had slowed after the first few weeks, Tree continued to grow faster than normal. After only a few months, Osoro could no longer wrap his arms around the trunk. The silver-tan bark was littered with knots from the rapid growth. They looked like eyes. Ten feet up, Tree's trunk split into a web of thick branches. Growing from the branches were what looked very much like pears, glowing with a faint yellow light. The effect was quite striking at night.

Tree did not respond.

"Mmm. You're right, I think." Osoro rubbed his chin thoughtfully, taking a seat on one of Tree's roots. "Perhaps a nice stone arrangement around the base is best. Monkey, I know it's a bother, but would you mind bringing some stones sometime today?"

Monkey lay nestled at the crook of several branches, staring out at the surrounding forest blankly. Monkey did not acknowledge Osoro's questions. He did not do much of anything these days. The poor creature was still heartbroken.

"Not to worry, Monkey. I suppose a bit of exercise would do me good anyways." 

There was so much work to do. The riverside arrangement had not been well suited for such a large addition. Especially one that insisted on increasing its size dramatically every few weeks. But Osoro had plans. The bridge was just the beginning. There would be a fountain, fed by the river, that would sit in the shade of the tree. He would replace the thick, bright green moss with something thinner and more demure. And of course a bench. It would be a lovely spot to appreciate the cicadas on warm Revel days such as this one. 

Osoro sat in Tree's shade for a moment longer. Delaying the inevitable. He wished he could stay here. Devoting all his time to improving the clearing. But these things took time. He had to be respectful of the existing plants as he worked. He could not simply change everything around them all at once. And the rest of the forest still needed tending.

Osoro stood reluctantly. He grabbed his shirt, draped across a tree branch, and pulled it over his head. He placed his hand against Tree's trunk. The smooth bark was cool against his palm. "See you soon."

He turned and walked from the clearing. The warmth of the sun left him as he entered the shade of the surrounding trees. He tried to hold onto the feeling, remembering the heat against his shoulders; the companionable silence leaning against Tree's trunk. He would return soon. He could be strong for just a little while. But with each step the feeling slipped through his fingers like sand. His limbs cooled. The loneliness returned.

Osoro paused, bending forward and placing a hand against the nearest pine tree. He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. His body felt feverish and brittle, like the solidness of his limbs had been lost with the sun's warmth. How could he do this without her? He just wanted to crawl amongst Tree's branches and hide away like Monkey. At least then she would always be near by.

Osoro felt a cold, wet nose nuzzle against his arm. It was gentle, but insistent. He looked up. Bear. Dependable Bear. She always followed him when he left the clearing, now. She watched over him, pushed him forward when he stumbled. Bear's presence gave Osoro the strength to carry on. But her concern made him feel even more fragile. What would he do without her?

Osoro stood and turned to Bear, looking into her sad eyes. "I believe the forest has become a scary place." He leaned forward, resting his forehead against hers. Her fur was warm. She smelled like dirt and moss. The two stood there for a moment in silence. 

"Shall we check on the eastern grove today?"

Leaving a hand against Bear's shoulder, Osoro continued up the mountain slope. He did not make it far before he felt a jitter of alarm across the back of his neck. He tensed and Bear looked over in concern.

"Bird. Something seems to be the matter." Osoro closed his eyes and reached out.

He was looking down from a tree branch near the western pass, seeing what Bird saw. A human woman picked her way through the trees. Her black hair was cut short and she wore a mix of close fitting green cloth and brown leathers. A bow was slung across her back. She moved into the valley carefully, but without much concern. She looked around at the well manicured trees and pathways, a faint smile across her face. 

Bird followed the woman as she moved further into the valley. She was heading for the river.

Osoro opened his eyes, returning to his surroundings. His hands shook. He knew this moment was coming. It was rare, but travelers found the valley from time to time. With Yuko around to keep them in check, the intrusions amounted to no more than a pleasant stroll through the woods. Osoro would receive praise for his work on the valley. With Yuko around, there had been nothing to fear.

But now the forest had become a scary place.

"We have a... a visitor. Perhaps we should return to Tree." Bear turned and the two began making their way back to the riverside. As they traveled, Osoro climbed onto Bear's back and watched the woman through Bird's eyes.

She made her way to the river, stopping to refill her water skin. She looked at the arrangements in awe. She seemed respectful enough.

After a moment, Osoro realized that the woman's path would take her directly to the clearing with Tree.

"Please do hurry, Bear." He wanted to run and hide away, but he could not risk letting this woman traipse about the clearing. What if she started a fire? Or broke a tree branch to whittle a new arrow?

The woman entered the clearing before Osoro and Bear made it back. Tree caught her eyes immediately - it was the only beech tree in the valley after all. The ranger's eyes traveled up the trunk. She looked at the glowing fruit amidst Tree's branches, curiosity written across her face. 

She took a few steps forwards before Monkey appeared, no longer invisible, hissing protectively from the upper branches. The woman reacted instinctively, reaching for her bow. 

Osoro opened his eyes, returning to his own vision. The woman stood with an arrow knocked, regarding Monkey warily. As Bear entered the clearing, the woman started and took several steps back, trying to keep everything in her field of view.

"Ah, I am sorry to startle you. Please, there is no need for violence. Monkey is only protecting the tree." Osoro gestured and Monkey stopped hissing, though he continued to watch the ranger with suspicion. Osoro dropped from Bear and held his hands up.

The woman kept her bow trained on Bear for a moment longer, eyes narrowed, before she reluctantly lowered the arrow. As some of the tension eased, the woman took a more careful look at Osoro. "You're a keeper aren't you? I've never seen one before."

Osoro bowed his head slightly. "Yes. My friends and I watch over this valley. I am called Osoro Kidani." His heart beat loudly in his ears. What would this woman do? Did she come to this valley intentionally, or did she simply stumble upon it?

"You can call me Trailfinder."

"It is a good name. May I ask why you are here?"

Trailfinder seemed to relax, though she kept an arrow knocked in her bow. "No particular reason. You might not know, but the Tournament just ended."

Pain shot through Osoro's heart. "Yes, I am aware."

"Well, there's going to be a new crop coming up, now that the old guard is cleared away. They'll be trying to make a name for themselves early in the new competition. People hire me as a guide to help them find challenges and adventure. I'm scouting for points of interest."

"You'll find no adventure here, I'm afraid. Just my gardens and my friends."

"What about that?" Monkey's fur stood on end as Trailfinder gestured towards Tree.

Osoro swallowed, his throat dry. "Ah, yes. Well." It was difficult to speak. His throat was tight and painful. Osoro realized he had not yet said it out loud. "That tree is special. But not in a way that you would find interesting."

"Why are its fruit glowing?"

"Her."

"Sorry... what?"

"_Her_ fruit, not 'its'. The tree is... it was my partner" Bear leaned her head against Osoro, offering support. "When a keeper passes away, their spirit forms a tree in the land that they were sworn to protect. A 'kodama' is how your people refer to it, I believe.

"My partner had a powerful spirit. Some of that strength still radiates from the tree. That is why her fruit glows."

"What happens if you eat one of the fruit?"

"I'm sorry, I have not tried."

"Aren't you curious?"

Osoro blinked, taken aback. "My friend Monkey can turn invisible. I do not look at him and wonder what would happen if I ate his flesh."

Trailfinder waved her hand dismissively. "That's different. Fruit is _meant_ to be eaten."

"Not this fruit, I'm afraid."

The woman huffed. "Come on, there are so many! Can't I try just one?" The desire was plain on her face.

Bear let loose a low growl, taking a step into the clearing.

"I'm sorry to be a bother, but this tree is very dear to us. Please understand. I wish you no harm, but I believe my friends will intervene if you try to take any fruit from the tree." Osoro's hands were slick with sweat. How had Yuko stood so calmly, laying down the rules for intruders before? He missed her strength so dearly.

Watching Bear, the woman took a step back from Tree. She held her hands up. "Alright, alright. Fine."

"If you don't mind, it's still early and there is much work to be done on the gardens. Are you able to continue on and leave this valley? If you would like to appreciate the gardens, I can suggest a suitable trail so that you do not disturb the mosses."

The woman acquiesced, eyeing the fruit one last time as she left along the trail Osoro indicated. Bear escorted her. Osoro was grateful for all his friends' vigilance.

When the woman was out of sight, Osoro sank to the ground with his back against Tree. He buried his face in his hands, tears running down his cheeks. Nothing had happened. But what if something had? More people would eventually stumble across the valley. What if they were not so easily sent away?

The garden was supposed to be safe. Protected. Yuko was supposed to be here, smiling warmly as she watched Osoro fretting over a shy bud or a stubborn tree branch.  

But she was gone. And the garden, the world he had so lovingly crafted, was now a scary place.

# Return
Most of the trees in Osoro's gardens were pines, providing the timeless look that he preferred. But Yuko had insisted there be at least one grove that changed with the seasons. He remembered that first crisp morning. They had awoken before dawn, walking along the misty trails in darkness to reach the copse before sunrise. They sat together amongst the trees, watching as the sunrise caught the leaves at the peak of their color. 

Osoro had smiled the entire day. Yuko was right of course. Since then, he had created many arrangements for the coming of Resolve and the changing of the leaves.

Osoro stood with his back against Tree. The ground in front of him was a smattering of orange and yellow. Suzume's resolve had come a month earlier and most of the trees had dropped their leaves. Pressed against Tree's trunk, his skin was the color of the bark behind him. The camouflage was a reflexive defense mechanism of all keepers.

Osoro should have seen it coming. Yuko would have. 

Standing at the edge of the clearing was a group of four. Two of the individuals were large, wearing full armor that covered their faces. They looked very comfortable with the two-handed blades they wielded. The third member of the group was a man who wore little in the way of protection. He was thin and lithe, with clothes that would not impede his movement. He wore two rows of daggers along a strip of leather that went from his left shoulder to his right hip.

The fourth member of the group, standing at the back with bow drawn, was Trailfinder.

Monkey hissed from the branches above Osoro. Bear stood in the middle of the clearing, blocking the group's passage.

"Please understand, this tree is very dear to us. We cannot give you her fruit any more than we could have betrayed her in life. Is there not something else we could offer?" Osoro's voice quivered faintly as he spoke.

"Sorry friend, I promised these three a glowing, mystical fruit. Not a pleasant stroll through gardens. Nothing against you or your animal friends, but I gotta make a living."

One of the armored figures stepped forward, raising their sword. "You mentioned a bear, but you didn't say how big it was! This beast will make a fine trophy." Their voice was masculine.

The other armored figure came forward as well, it sounded like a woman beneath the metal visor. "Now, don't you two get jealous when I'm the one to slay the thing and my bounty goes higher than both of yours combined!"

Osoro watched in dismay. They bantered with one another lightly, like they played some sort of game. They fancied themselves heroes. Bear was their monster, Tree was their reward. How could he stop them? The two armored figures began to circle to Bear's flanks.

Seeing herself surrounded, Bear roared and lashed out towards the armored man on her left. The man raised his sword in surprise, managing to get the blade in front of Bear's claw, but his strength was nothing compared to the ten foot tall bear's. His elbows buckled. Bear's claw, and the sword beneath, went crashing into the man's chest, knocking him sprawling on the ground.

"Hah! Watch how it's really done!" Taking advantage of Bear's focus on the man, the armored woman leapt forward with her sword, swinging down against Bear's flank. The woman cut a large gash and Bear cried out in pain. She turned her hulking frame towards the armored woman and snapped her jaws. But the woman was careful to step back out of range, avoiding Bear's teeth.

The agile man darted forward quickly, pulling two daggers from the belt along his shoulder. He planted one foot on Bear's massive shoulder and vaulted onto her back, sinking both daggers into her fur. Bear growled and shook herself, trying unsuccessfully to dislodge the man with the daggers. The armored man who had been knocked prone brought himself back to his feet, shaking his head and retrieving his sword.

Osoro stood at the base of Tree helpless. His mind raced. What could he do? There was a large rock between the roots at his feet. Could he hurl it at one of them. What would it even do against their armor?

Monkey screeched as he leapt from Tree's upper branches. As he flew through the air, Trailfinder - still standing far back - loosed her bow at him. The arrow missed, embedding itself in Tree. Dark red sap began to seep around the projectile.

Monkey landed on Bear's back, still screeching wildly. The agile man with the daggers turned, drawing another blade from the belt strapped around his chest. The two armored figures looked up. Monkey's body tensed and his fur began to glow. 

Yuko had given him the ability to absorb and emit light, something he usually used to turn invisible and avoid work. But now he released a concentrated flash of blinding white light. Osoro, recognizing what Monkey was doing, closed his eyes against the light pulse. He heard the group of intruders all cry out in surprise. There was a heavy thud.

When Osoro opened his eyes, the man with daggers lay on his back on the ground. He was wrestling frantically with some invisible force, scratches opening along his face and arms out of nowhere. Monkey continued to screech as he attacked. 

The armored man was stepping backwards, flailing with his sword blindly to prevent Bear from approaching. Trailfinder and the armored woman were similarly blinded.

The man slashing about with his sword stumbled backwards into a tree. He cried out an spun, fearing an attack from behind. Osoro's heart sank even further as the man's sword arced down on one of the tree limbs, snapping it. That tree limb had taken years to shape.

Bear leapt onto the armored woman, taking advantage of her blindness to pin her to the ground. There was a nasty crunch as Bear's full weight landed on one of the woman's arms. She cried out in pain and swung her sword wildly with the other arm, forcing bear to pull back and avoid the blow.

Regaining her sight, Trailfinder knocked an arrow and fired at Bear. The missile embedded itself in the thick fur around Bear's neck, causing her to cry in pain again. The woman, still pinned beneath Bear, dropped her sword and drew a long dagger, stabbing the blade into one of Bear's front legs. Bear roared and bit down on the woman's shoulder, near her neck. The metal resisted Bear's teeth, but it began to groan and bend under the pressure. The woman screamed in fear.

The armored man, able to see again hefted his sword and charged at Bear's back, rushing to help his comrade. Osoro lifted the rock at his feet and hurled it at the man. He hardly even slowed as the rock bounced harmlessly off his armor.

The armored man reached Bear and brought his sword down in a massive two handed swing, laying open Bear's back leg. The swing carried downwards, digging a deep gouge through the moss along the floor of the clearing. Bear groaned but did not flinch away. She pressed down harder with her jaws. One of Bear's teeth punctured the metal of the woman's armor, sinking into the flesh of her shoulder. Blood poured out. The woman slashed wildly at Bear's neck, in a blind panic as she saw her life coming to an end.

At birth, a keeper was given some part of the land to look after. Preserving that land against the encroachment of civilization was everything. It was a keeper's reason for existing. Osoro's very name - Kidani - evoked the valley around him.

Osoro looked at the clearing in horror. Broken tree limbs, no longer bending slowly towards their ideal arrangement. Delicate mosses with deep furrows gouged and large areas flattened by falling bodies. The wonderful, verdant green mottled with red blood, turning the ground an ugly brown. The bleeding arrow wound in Tree's trunk. 

He watched as the man with daggers got hold of Monkey and threw him bodily against a nearby tree. He saw Bear's form, prickled with arrows and daggers, bleeding profusely. He saw the armored man rearing up to deliver another vicious blow.

He couldn't lose the gardens. He couldn't lose Bear. Or Monkey. There was already so much pain. How could he go on without these things?

"Stop!" Osoro cried out, screaming with such panic he felt his voice cracking. The cry was so raw, it shook everyone from their fury. The man with daggers paused as he got to his feet. Trailfinder hesitated, an arrow half drawn. Bear released her jaws. The woman pinned beneath was unconscious. Whether from blood loss or sheer terror was hard to tell. The armored man lowered his sword.

Frustrated tears streamed down Osoro's face as he continued. "If we give you the fruit, will you leave? Please. You are hurt. We are hurt. We will give you the fruit and let you leave. Just go without causing more harm."

The man with daggers looked across his companions, his face bleeding freely from several deep scratches along his face. The woman was very nearly dead, and probably needed immediate medical attention if she hoped to survive. Her left arm would probably never be the same.

The man nodded, sheathing the daggers in his hand. "OK, fair enough." He looked at his comrade and the armored man stepped away from Bear.

Bear stepped back, favoring the front leg that the armored woman had stabbed repeatedly. Bear limped back to the base of Tree.

The intruders quickly regrouped around their fallen comrade, dragging her to the edge of the clearing. They pried off her armor and Trailfinder began wrapping the woman's shoulder tightly with a bandage. Their previous excitement replaced by grim shock.

Numbly, Osoro climbed Tree. He extended a hand towards the nearest fruit. He paused with his arm outstretched, feeling the smooth skin of the fruit against his fingers. "I'm sorry, love." He closed his eyes and plucked the fruit. There was a brief moment of resistance before the stem broke free. Osoro felt Tree shudder faintly beneath him.

Osoro climbed back to the ground. He could not meet Bear or Monkey's eyes as he walked towards the intruders. The clearing suddenly felt like a great distance, taking an eternity to cross. Osoro flinched as the armored man took the fruit with rough, dirty hands.

Trailfinder took the limb that had been broken during the fight. She angled it against a tree trunk and stomped violently near the center. Once. Twice. The limb snapped, loud like bone. They used it to form a litter and placed the armored woman on it.

Eventually, they left. 

Osoro sat with Bear's paw in his lap. He tended to the deep wounds while in a sort of stupor. What were they going to do? His fears had come to pass and they were right.

Monkey sat amongst Tree's branches, staring with contempt at Osoro. Monkey's glare was full of accusations. He had betrayed Yuko. He was weak. Unworthy of the gardens around him.

"I do not disagree with you, my friend. But I do not know what I could have done differently." He felt hollow. Would Yuko have forgiven him for his choice?
