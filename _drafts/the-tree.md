# Beginning at the end
Osoro Kidani sat on a large stone, staring at a soft, mossy patch next to the river. The air was crisp but the sun was high and bright, warming him slowly. The occasional gust, cutting through the valley on its way out the other side, pulled the hard-earned heat from him with greedy fingers, leaving him shivering as he waited for the sun to warm him again. 

He knew he should move. The black pines along the Eastern slope were in need of new supports. He would need to make a decision soon about how he wanted to shape them further. With the sun so clear in the sky, he really ought to see to some of the more exposed mosses. They were such fragile things.

Chinami's Rebirth was just beginning. The river raged, swollen with snowmelt from the mountains above, announcing the changing of seasons with forceful pride. Osoro smiled for a moment, reminded of Yuko. She loved the river during Rebirth. Osoro preferred the more subtle blossoming of his plants. The gentle spread of green as mosses reclaimed the hillside from the snows. The coyness of the cherry blossoms, their buds peaking before they stepped fully into the sun.

Osoro sat for a moment longer, feeling the heat emanating from the hard rock beneath him. He let out a shaky sigh and pushed himself off the rock, brushing dirt from his hands. He was tall, with slender limbs and delicate features. Because it was nearly Rebirth, the dull ochre of his skin was shifting to a verdant green. The vines and leaves that sprouted from his head like hair were returning to life. 

He took one final look at the moss beside the river before turning his back on the boisterous waters. Well-manicured woods sprawled before him. The rough-barked pines twisted intricately, held aloft by stilts of sturdy bamboo. Stone pathways crawled between the trees, seeking out the shaded groves and windswept viewpoints that Osoro cherished.

On a nearby tree, a small white-and-black mottled bird stared down at Osoro, its head cocked sideways. He felt a questing sense of curiosity from the bird, plucking at his mind. Osoro looked up at the bird, eyes closed in a smile. "I'll head to the Eastern grove, I think. Perhaps you could check the mosses along the riverbank? I'm sorry to be a bother, Bird. Normally Yuko would check but we'll just have to make do until she returns." 

Bird chirped and took off from the branch. Osoro called after as is fluttered towards the water's edge. "Oh! Please do land gently!"

Osoro passed the rest of the day pleasantly. He checked on the black pines, further up the mountainside. They were coming along nicely. Perhaps another 10 or 15 years and their shapes would be where he wanted them. Not too long. He was a Keeper after all.

He checked in a couple times with Bird. Sharing the creature's sight long enough to note the dryer patches and ensure that she wasn't rooting around in the delicate mosses for worms. She was incorrigible. Osoro would sleep easier when Yuko returned. Bird was better behaved when Yuko was there to discipline.

On his way back from the higher slopes of the valley, Osoro came across Bear and Monkey. Bear worked to push a large boulder across a clearing. Over 10 feet at the shoulder, Bear often took care of the more physically strenuous tasks around the forest. Osoro had asked her to move the rock further into the shade so that it caught a more gentle sunlight. He had plans for a wonderful sea-blue lichen that would compliment the clearing marvelously. 

A deep furrow in the ground marked the path of the boulder. Monkey was supposed to be filling and smoothing the furrow. Instead he slept atop the boulder Bear was pushing. When Monkey saw Osoro approaching, he sniffed in surprise and winked out of sight, turning invisible. Osoro shook his head and continued back towards the river.

Yuko had left her three familiars behind to help Osoro care for the forest. He hoped that she wouldn't need them or their abilities in the trials she faced.

Yuko was a spark, a shifter who could do more than just take on the form of animals within her domain. Just as adepts could shape the magic they used, sparks could alter and enhance the creatures to which they were bound, imbuing them with powers. 

Osoro was grateful for Yuko's abilities. They were a marvelous gift. When they weren't causing problems, at least. 

Osoro reminded himself that those problems were nearly over. When Yuko returned a Champion, the gods could no longer hunt her.

The sun was setting as the Osoro reached the bottom of the hills. He took the long path home, the one that veered towards the river before continuing on to the secluded grove where he and Yuko lived. Just one more check to see that the spot remained clear. The peace of mind would help him sleep better. 

Osoro rounded a corner and the river came into view. His eyes immediately jumped to the familiar spot. The spot that had been empty every day of the last three weeks. 

The spot that now had a sapling sprouting at its center. 

Osoro rushed forward, unable to believe his eyes. The sapling was small, but growing visibly. Leaves opened tentatively along the branches, like a newborn deer uncertain of the legs beneath it. "Oh." Osoro dropped to his knees, crushing the fragile moss beneath him. He reached for the small tree before him, his hands shaking as they hesitated, outstretched.

Then Osoro wept.

# First Contact
Osoro stood, placing his hands on his hips and arching his back as he stretched. The river's cool waters swirled around his legs and the warm sun beat against his bared back. Emiko's Revel was the best time for working on the water features. Osoro looked at the bridge with pride. It formed a semi-circle, arcing over the river like a leaping deer. 

The bridge was young and raw, out of place amongst the stately elegance of the surrounding forest. But time would fix that. The wind and the sun would weather the wood. Mosses would reclaim the churned earth on either side. Soon it would be at home with its new surroundings.

"What do you think, Tree?" Osoro waded from the waters, making his way towards the beech tree growing near the river. Though it's growth had slowed after the first few weeks, Tree continued to grow faster than normal. After only a few months, Osoro could no longer wrap his arms around the trunk. The silver-tan bark was littered with knots from the rapid growth. They looked like eyes. Ten feet up, Tree's trunk split into a web of thick branches. Growing from the branches were what looked very much like pears, glowing with a faint yellow light. The effect was quite striking at night.

Tree did not respond.

"Mmm. You're right, I think." Osoro rubbed his chin thoughtfully, taking a seat on one of Tree's roots. "Perhaps a nice stone arrangement around the base is best. Monkey, I know it's a bother, but would you mind bringing some stones sometime today?"

Monkey lay nestled at the crook of several branches, staring out at the surrounding forest blankly. Monkey did not acknowledge Osoro's questions. He did not do much of anything these days. The poor creature was still heartbroken.

"Not to worry, Monkey. I suppose a bit of exercise would do me good anyways." 

There was so much work to do. The riverside arrangement had not been well suited for such a large addition. Especially one that insisted on increasing its size dramatically every few weeks. But Osoro had plans. The bridge was just the beginning. There would be a fountain, fed by the river, that would sit in the shade of the tree. He would replace the thick, bright green moss with something thinner and more demure. And of course a bench. It would be a lovely spot to appreciate the cicadas on warm Revel days such as this one. 

Osoro sat in Tree's shade for a moment longer. Delaying the inevitable. He wished he could stay here. Devoting all his time to improving the clearing. But these things took time. He had to be respectful of the existing plants as he worked. He could not simply change everything around them all at once. And the rest of the forest still needed tending.

Osoro stood reluctantly. He grabbed his shirt, draped across a tree branch, and pulled it over his head. He placed his hand against Tree's trunk. The smooth bark was cool against his palm. "See you soon."

He turned and walked from the clearing. The warmth of the sun left him as he entered the shade of the surrounding trees. He tried to hold onto the feeling, remembering the heat against his shoulders; the companionable silence resting against Tree's trunk. He would return soon. He could be strong for just a little while. But with each step the feeling slipped through his fingers like sand. His limbs cooled. The loneliness returned.

Osoro paused, bending forward and placing a hand against the nearest pine tree. He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. His body felt feverish and brittle, like the solidness of his limbs had been lost with the sun's warmth. How could he do this without her? He just wanted to crawl amongst Tree's branches and hide away like Monkey. At least then she would always be near by.

Osoro felt a cold, wet nose nuzzle against his arm. It was gentle, but insistent. He looked up. Bear. Dependable Bear. She always followed him when he left the clearing, now. She watched over him, pushed him forward when he stumbled. Bear's presence gave Osoro the strength to carry on. But her concern made him feel even more fragile. What would he do without her?

Osoro stood and turned to Bear, looking into her sad eyes. "I believe the forest has become a scary place." He leaned forward, resting his forehead against hers. Her fur was warm. She smelled like dirt and moss. The two stood there for a moment in silence. 

"Shall we check on the eastern grove today?"

Leaving a hand against Bear's shoulder, Osoro continued up the mountain slope. He did not make it far before he felt a jitter of alarm across the back of his neck. He tensed and Bear looked over in concern.

"Bird. Something seems to be the matter." Osoro closed his eyes and reached out.

He was looking down from a tree branch near the western pass, seeing what Bird saw. A human woman picked her way through the trees. Her black hair was cut short and she wore a mix of close fitting green cloth and brown leathers. A bow was slung across her back. She moved into the valley carefully, but without much concern. She looked around at the well manicured trees and pathways, a faint smile across her face. 

Bird followed the woman as she moved further into the valley. She was heading for the river.

Osoro opened his eyes, returning to his surroundings. His hands shook. He knew this moment was coming. It was rare, but travelers found the valley from time to time. With Yuko around to keep them in check, the intrusions amounted to no more than a pleasant stroll through the woods. Osoro would receive praise for his work on the valley. With Yuko around, there had been nothing to fear.

But now the forest had become a scary place.

"We have a... a visitor. Perhaps we should return to Tree." Bear turned and the two returned to the river side. As they traveled, Osoro climbed onto Bear's back and watched the woman through Bird's eyes.

She made her way to the river, stopping to refill her water skin. She looked at the arrangements in awe. She seemed respectful enough.

After a moment, Osoro realized that the woman had decided to travel along the river. Her path would take her directly to the clearing with Tree.

"Please do hurry, Bear." He wanted to run and hide away, but he could not risk letting this woman traipse about the clearing. What if she started a fire? Or broke a tree branch to whittle a new arrow? What if she tried to take a fruit from Tree?

The woman entered the clearing. Tree caught her eyes immediately - it was the only beech tree in the valley after all. The ranger's eyes traveled up the trunk. She looked at the glowing fruit amidst Tree's branches, curiosity written across her face. 

She took a few steps towards Tree before Monkey appeared, no longer invisible, hissing protectively from the upper branches. The woman reacted instinctively, reaching for her bow. 

Osoro opened his eyes, returning to his own vision. The woman stood with an arrow knocked, regarding Monkey warily. As Bear entered the clearing, the woman started and took several steps back, trying to keep everything in her field of view.

"Ah, I am sorry to startle you. Please, there is no need for violence. Monkey is only protecting the tree." Osoro gestured and Monkey stopped hissing, though he continued to watch the ranger with suspicion. Osoro dropped from Bear and held his hands up.

The woman kept her bow trained on Bear for a moment longer, eyes narrowed, before she reluctantly lowered the arrow. As some of the tension eased, the woman took a more careful look at Osoro. "You're a keeper aren't you? I've never seen one before."

Osoro bowed his head slightly. "Yes. My friends and I watch over this valley. I am called Osoro Kidani." His heart beat loudly in his ears. What would this woman do? Did she come to this valley intentionally, or did she simply stumble upon it? Did she intend to take Tree's fruit?

"You can call me Trailfinder."

"It is a good name. May I ask why you are here?"

Trailfinder seemed to relax as it seemed there would be no fight. Though she kept an arrow knocked in her bow. "No particular reason. You might not know, but the Tournament just ended."

Pain shot through Osoro's heart. "Yes, I am aware."

"Well, there's going to be a new crop coming up, now that the old guard is cleared away. They'll be trying to make a name for themselves early in the new competition. People hire me as a guide to help them find challenges and adventure. I'm scouting for points of interest."

"You'll find no adventure here, I'm afraid. Just my gardens and my friends."

The woman eyed Tree. "What about that?" Monkey's fur stood on end as Trailfinder gestured towards Tree.

Osoro swallowed, his throat dry. "Ah, yes. Well." It was difficult to speak. His throat was tight and painful. Osoro realized he had not yet said it out loud. "That tree is special. But not in a way that you would find interesting."

"Why are its fruit glowing?"

"It is... it was my partner."

"Sorry... what?"

Bear leaned her head against Osoro, offering support. "When a keeper passes away, their spirit forms a tree in the land that they were sworn to protect. A 'kodama' is how most people refer to it, I believe.

"My partner had a powerful spirit. Some of that strength still radiates from the tree. That is why her fruit glows."

"What happens if you eat one?"

"I'm sorry, I have not tried."

"Aren't you curious?"

Osoro blinked, taken aback. "My friend Monkey can turn invisible. I do not look at him and wonder what would happen if I ate his flesh."

Trailfinder waved her hand dismissively. "That's different. Fruit is _meant_ to be eaten."

"Not this fruit, I'm afraid."

The woman huffed. "Come on, there are so many! Can't I try just one?" The desire was plain on her face.

Bear let loose a low growl, taking a step into the clearing.

"I'm sorry to be a bother, but this tree is very dear to us. Please understand. I wish you no harm, but I believe my friends will intervene if you try to take any fruit from the tree." Osoro's hands were slick with sweat. How had Yuko stood so calmly, laying down the rules for intruders before? He missed her strength so dearly.

Watching Bear, the woman took a step back from Tree. She held her hands up. "Alright, alright. Fine."

"If you don't mind, it's still early and there is much work to be done on the gardens. Are you able to continue on and leave this valley? If you would like to appreciate the gardens, I can suggest a suitable trail so that you do not disturb the mosses."

The woman acquiesced, eyeing the fruit one last time as she left along the trail Osoro indicated. Bear escorted her. Osoro was grateful for all his friends' vigilance.

When the woman was out of sight, Osoro sank to the ground with his back against Tree. He buried his face in his hands, tears running down his cheeks. Nothing had happened. But what if something had? More people would eventually stumble across the valley. What if they were not so easily sent away?

The garden was supposed to be safe. Protected. Yuko was supposed to be here, smiling warmly as she watched Osoro fretting over a shy bud or a stubborn tree branch.  

But she was gone. And the garden, the world he had so lovingly crafted, was now a scary place.

# Return
Osoro should have seen it coming. Yuko would have.
