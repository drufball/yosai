They darted from shadows to alleys to abandoned crates and carts, barely keeping ahead of the Arbiter search parties storming the city. Every clang of the alarm bell knotted Denri's stomach tighter. It called for her.

They knew who she was. Even before she blasted one of the city guards, they had enough information to be suspicious of an unknown flit woman. But now there was no doubt. No way she could hide.

They had to get out of the city, but Denri wouldn't leave Shiri and Onara. She couldn't. For years it had only been the three of them, living on the streets of Terminus. But what if the innkeeper had recognized Denri from the bounty description? What if the Arbiters were already swarming around the Dragon's Den?

They reached the platform with the giant dragon statue, its stone talons clutching endlessly at the gold painted hoard that made its perch. Denri felt a spark of hope when she saw the steel walkways that cut across the grass were empty. But the guards would be inside. Below the platform and out of sight in order to surprise them.

Denri and Aki hid in an alley on an adjacent platform as Eizo approached the statue. He knocked, body tense as he prepared to run if trouble met him on the other side of the door. But when Anko appeared, she hurried him inside, eyes darting left and right as she closed the door behind him.

A few moments later, Eizo emerged and came to their hiding spot. "Come, it's safer inside."

Denri puffed out her cheeks as she released the breath she hadn't realized she was holding. "Are you sure?"

"I am." He led them back to the statue where Anko was waiting. She nodded as they entered.

"I figured you all might be coming back. Those cats have been meowing in your room all day. I would have seen to them if I weren't afraid they'd just bolt as soon as I opened the door."

"Thank you." Denri looked to Eizo uncertainly, but Anko clapped a hand against her shoulder. "Eh, none of that! I didn't tell the Arbiters to go blow smoke just so you could be suspicious of me. You're safe here lass." She smiled as she pulled back her sleeve to show a tattoo. A circle with six hatch marks around the perimeter. The same tattoo that Eizo bore.

"You're a--!" Anko clamped a hand over Aki's mouth with lightning speed.

"Careful now, lass. That's not something to go broadcasting. Yes, I was. Not a fighter like this one. I worked as a healer before I-- well, Eizo and I have a fair bit in common. I sensed him straight away, even if his bond is dead, more or less.

"If I wanted to turn you lot in, I would have done it as I saw him. I tried to come and warn you all about the bounty this morning, but you'd already left."

"Thank you." Denri spoke more earnestly.

Anko waved her hand. "For a looker like this? I'd sell out my own husband. Not that I have one, thank the Mother's Scales." She winked at Eizo. "Now let's get you all to your room. The Arbiters have locked down the Tether, but you can hide here until things die down a bit. They can't keep the city locked up for long."

They walked down the stairs in silence for a moment before Aki cleared her throat. "Did you really tell the Arbiters to go blow smoke?"

Anko barked a laugh. "No, lass. Even I'm not that crazy. But I did tell them I'd never seen hide nor hair of you. And when I started leering at their captain he finished up his questions nice and quick. Not that I was looking seriously now, dear."

Anko placed a hand on Eizo's back as she laughed, but she was alone in her amusement.

When they opened the door to their room, Shiri and Onara dashed to Denri, winding their way around her legs as they meowed anxiously. Denri couldn't help but smile.

"Alright, alright, calm down you little monsters." She bent and scooped Shiri into her arms as she nudged Onara towards Eizo. Denri gave the man a look and he dutifully lifted the black cat into his arms. Denri held Shiri to her face, rubbing his nose with hers. "There, see? I'm never gonna leave you two."

She looked under the beds warily. "They don't know a thing about what's happened, why are they so freaked out?"

"I think they sensed my fear when I reached out to check on them." Aki was leaning over Eizo's shoulder, rubbing Onara between the eyes.

Denri turned to Eizo. "OK, I'm ready to go."

"Like I said, they've got the Tether shut down. No way out of Sky Furnace until that's reopened."

Denri turned back toward the front of the room, only now realizing that Anko had slipped in with them. Denri glanced at Eizo, wondering what to do about the elderly woman.

"Don't go lookin' at him like he gets to decide. I'm already up to my elbows after lying to the Arbiters. And besides, it's my inn. So let's have it." Anko waved her arms. "Off with the masks and tell me what's going on."

No one removed their masks. Even Aki narrowed her eyes suspiciously. "Why are you helping us?"

"I read the bounty report. After what you did, there's no way you'd risk coming to a city unless you had a purpose." She hesitated, then seemed to reach a decision before she continued. "I've got no love for Ninigi and his Blades. I want them out of my city.

"You took out five Blades and you're traveling with a deserter, so I'm hoping whatever you're up to, it's against them. If it is, I'll help how I can. But I'd like to know I'm not helping a bunch of criminals who are trying to hurt Sky Furnace. So you can show some trust or I'll turn you in."

"I guess we don't have much choice either way." Denri shook her head as she and Aki removed their masks.Â "Did you say there are Blades here in Sky Furnace?"

Eizo's mask remained in place. "The Arbiters. For the most part, the Blades trained in Ninigi's Citadel are sent to his Champions. But he gives a few to the other gods to curry favor."

"Act as spies, more like it." Anko's lip curled distastefully.

"Why couldn't the Arbiters sense you like Anko could, then?"

"They're pledged to Amaterasu. The oath that Blades take only allows them to sense creatures bound to the same god. The only reason I can sense him is because I used to be tied to Ninigi as well."

Anko cleared her throat loudly, looking pointedly at Eizo's mask. "Don't push your luck just because I think you're handsome, lad. Off with the mask." She reached towards the door to emphasize her point.

Eizo's hand moved haltingly to his face. Distrust warring with necessity as he pulled the mask free.

When he did, Anko gasped. She stood, mouth hanging open for a moment before she regained enough composure to speak. "_Takeshi Foxbane._"

Eizo shifted uncomfortably. "I no longer hold the blade. I use my birth name once again."

Denri's gaze shifted between the two. Again, she found herself burning with curiosity about Eizo's past. "You know him?"

"Not personally. I doubt any would recognize you with your face so gaunt and scarred like that. Mother help me but I wouldn't have either if I hadn't seen you once before. The stories I heard of how you left... I was right, then. You _are_ here to fight the Blades."

"Hold on now. What happened when Eizo left where?"

Eizo held up a hand firmly. "This is not the time for sharing stories. We need to find a way out of Sky Furnace."

Anko was looking at Eizo with a new sense of awe. It only made Denri more curious. "There are some amongst the Blades who disapprove of how their strength is being used. Depressingly few, but some none the less. Takeshi-- Eizo, you would not know, but your desertion had larger effects than anyone could have guessed. If word spread that the Last Standing was in Sky Furnace, opposing the Blades, some of the Arbiters may rally to your cause. They could help you."

"No. I will not lead men and women again. Not in violence."

"But--."

"I said _no_." There was a commanding force to Eizo's voice that stopped Anko dead, her jaw clicking shut as she nodded. "Besides, it would bring more attention than we want. We're in Sky Furnace to gather information, not to start a conflict. We hoped to gather information on someone who sells technology to the Blades. But we were only able to get a name before we were discovered."

Denri flinched. Eizo said _we_, but it was her who the Arbiters recognized. "A man named Shinmon. He makes the--." Denri paused, realizing that Eizo wasn't sharing specifics. "The technology. We can still try to find him and get the information!"

Eizo shook his head. "It's too risky. The whole city is on high alert and they're looking _specifically_ for us. We'll just have to find another lead."

Anko tapped her lip thoughtfully. "Shinmon, you said? I've never heard the name, but I could ask around. Moving through the city might be too dangerous, but I could find out if he's undocking anytime soon. Maybe you could make a move in a different city."

"We don't have the time to wait."

"Nonsense, lad." Anko was halfway toward batting Eizo's chest before she remembered herself, pulling her hand back like she had stuck it in a viper pit. "I mean, forgive me for disagreeing Ta-- Eizo. You'll have to stay here at least until the Tether is reopened. At least let me try to help until then."

Eizo frowned, clearly uncomfortable with the situation. Eventually he nodded. "I suppose we have to trust someone if we're going to get out of here. And it would be good not to end this journey empty handed.

Denri lay in her bed, staring at the ceiling. Sleep wouldn't come. Every noise sent her ears straining for the sounds of foot steps and creaking armor. All she heard was the blood pounding in her ears.

Hiding again. Every time she thought she was getting a hold on things, something came crashing through, upending her confidence. One step forward, four steps back. And there was still so much they didn't understand.

She didn't used to care when she didn't know things. She trusted her instincts, taking things one step at a time. But how could she improvise when it was Eizo and Aki's lives at stake? She wouldn't risk them getting hurt. She hadn't been able to help her parents. This family she would protect.

They needed to get stronger. Strong enough to fight back against everyone pursuing them. But that wouldn't happen overnight. And they were being hunted _now_. Denri knuckled her forehead, forcing herself to focus on a plan. They could keep running, or they could find strong allies. But they wouldn't know where was safe or who to trust until they knew what was going on.

Learning more about Aki's power was the path forward for everything. It would help Aki train and it would help them maneuver around Sadashi. If Anko was able to gather information on Shinmon, they could follow him to whatever city he visited next. But even then, who knew how long he would stay in Sky Furnace. Or where he might be going. All that time they'd be running blind.

Denri chewed her lip in frustration. What they needed was right in front of them. But Eizo said they had to be careful. Avoid risks.

But doing nothing was a risk too. _She_ was a risk.

Denri dropped her hands to the bed. A sense of dread filled her. The Arbiters only had information on her. If she was gone, Eizo and Aki would at least have more time to train and find out what was going on. What if Eizo decided that Denri was more trouble than she was worth?

She shook her head. Eizo trusted her. Cared about her. He wouldn't abandon her just because things were getting hard. But he still wouldn't tell her anything about his past. Did he _really_ trust her?

And should he? If Denri was the problem, then shouldn't she leave to protect them? But she didn't want to be alone.

Denri wanted to scream. Her hands tensed like claws at her side. Everything ran in circles. The more she thought, the more uncertain she became. Every direction had tradeoffs. Good and bad that were impossible to measure against each other. The deeper she probed, the more paralyzed she felt.

Denri sat up abruptly, her tension translating into motion. She couldn't do this. She couldn't plan for every problem. If she tried, she was just going to fail. Her strength had always been action. The stakes were higher, but she had to keep playing the game she knew.

Shinmon was here now. That was certain. That was the opportunity. Denri eased the covers back and placed her feet on the cold metal floor. If she went alone, at least the others would be safe. If she got caught, they'd be able to escape. And if she found important information, Eizo wouldn't think about leaving.

Denri nodded to herself, certainty easing the tension in her shoulders. She snuck to their packs by the door and slipped the folded map from the outer pocket. She had no problem reading it in the dark, her blue flit eyes shining.

She found the mark for Shinmon's shop on the far side of Sky Furnace, in the opposite direction of Anchor. But the far side was less dense. She could move quickly and make it back before the sun showed on the horizon. A smile hitched the corner of her mouth as she turned to the door.

Shiri's shining green eyes stared back at her. The white and orange cat blinked and Aki sat up.

"You're leaving."

"I thought you were asleep."

Aki shook her head. "Where are you going?"

"I just want to get some air. Calm my nerves so I can get some sleep."

Aki searched her face. "You're going to find Shinmon." She threw the covers back.

Denri sighed. "Yeah. But I'm going alone. You go back to bed. There's no reason for us all to take the risk."

Aki slid out of bed and shot Denri a stubborn look. "I'm coming. This is all my fault. Everyone is trying to get _me_. And the Arbiters found us because I lost my temper."

Denri nearly laughed. So she wasn't the only one lying awake berating herself. She felt a moment of concern and almost insisted that Aki stay. Then she took a deep breath and pushed it aside. No more worrying. The Stormbringer's was telling her Aki was part of the opportunity.

Denri felt a moment of shock when she realized how long it had been since she thought of Susano. She looked to the ceiling and muttered an apology to the Lord of Storms.

"Eizo won't let us go."

Aki flashed a mischievous grin. "Who asked him?" Denri realized she was smiling too.

<br />

Denri knew they had made the right decision. Everything flowed as she darted through the night. She rolled over a wall, darting across an open park to a warehouse at the far side of the platform. She jumped without slowing, planted a foot on a crate, and threw herself towards the wall.

Time slowed as she called lightning, letting it fill her body. Her momentum held her against the wall for an instant, it felt like several seconds. She looked around lazily as her body coiled. Then she pushed off and up, clearing the 20 foot rooftop of the neighboring building with ease.

She landed in a crouch beside Shiri. The cat sat staring into the night. Watching for the Arbiters that even now were turning the city upside down looking for them.

She felt a tug in her mind, guiding her left. Aki had found a clear path around the nearest patrol.

Sadashi wanted to isolate them by reporting Denri. But he didn't say anything about Aki, trying to hide his true target. That left the Arbiters blind, unsuspecting of a black cat picking its way through the town.

Denri almost laughed. She had been so afraid while they ran. But now she felt invincible. Sadashi could search and scheme and be as clever as they wanted. All he did was tie himself in knots, leaving opportunities for Denri to act.

With Shiri and Aki charting a course around any searching eyes, Denri flew across Sky Furnace. She barely even had to stop. It wasn't long before the three of them were standing in an alleyway looking across a bridge at their target.

Shinmon's zeppelin was small compared to the rest of Sky Furnace. The platform held a narrow tower standing across from a simple workshop. Manicured gardens filled the space that remained. The workshop was dark and dormant, but the windows in the tower shone brightly.
