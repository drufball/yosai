"What are you doing here?"

The warehouse behind Keta rocked with another series of explosions, the glass windows toward the roof blowing out into the street. The concussive bursts were getting closer together as more of the building caught fire. Even a block away, the heat could be felt.

"I wished to... apologize for my words earlier. I was harsh."

Thoughts of the recent fight, and the warehouse burning down the street, momentarily left Moto in his shock. "How did you...?"

Keta turned, overcoming his own surprise. He dropped to a crouch and Moto felt a surge in the heat around him. "We will discuss later! There may be those who need our help."

"No! The building could collapse any second. Let the guards handle it."

"The guards are not here. We are." Keta shot forward, leaping into the burning warehouse without a moment's hesitation. Moto groaned and followed. Nothing to do now but get it over with as quickly as possible.

The explosions had all been contained to the back half, so most of the workers had fled without difficulty. There was a handful of workers who had been trapped when the dividing wall collapsed from the explosions, but with Keta's strength they were able to free them quickly.

Moto swung from the ceiling, doing a quick circle of the room to confirm that there were no more workers. He landed next to Keta with flames throwing heat from two sides. "It's empty, let's get out of here!"

Keta nodded to the collapsed divider. The room on the other side was completely engulfed. "We have not checked there."

Moto looked at him with jaw dropped. There wasn't a patch of ground larger than a few feet that wasn't on fire or exploding. He couldn't be serious. "Are you *crazy*? It's an inferno over there. There is zero chance anyone is still alive and a hundred percent chance you'll die."

"How would you feel if it was you? Trapped and knowing that no one would come."

Moto shook his head in disbelief. This was suicide. And even if it wasn't, whatever time they had until the guards showed up had to be nearly gone. He couldn't let them get linked to this. There would be too many questions. But Keta had that determined look on his face again.

"Keta, there's no one in there. I'm sure of it."

"How can you be certain?"

"Because... I was in there when the fire started. I saw the only people in there die before I fled." It wasn't entirely true, one of the workers and their prisoner had been alive but trapped. But it might as well be true. There was no way they were still alive.

Keta narrowed his eyes. "Are you sure?"

"Yes. Please, just trust me. We have to get out of here!"

The shapeling took one last look across the warehouse, then nodded reluctantly. Moto led the way back to the warehouse entrance and peered outside, looking for guards. There were none. Moto thanked his luck for how little the city guard cared about the Icepackers Ward as they ran across the street and into the winding alleyways.

They walked in silence for several minutes until the roar of the burning warehouse was a distance din. Dimly, Moto was curious how Keta had come to be near the warehouse, but he was too consumed with other thoughts at the moment.

Did he leave any clues? Would Soundstealer make the connection about their presence in Jidoka? Had anyone seen him? Moto thought of the woman who he paid to guide him. She was a loose end connecting him directly. Should he try to slip away from Keta and take care of her?

They were just turning out onto the main thoroughfare to Frost Gate when Keta grabbed Moto's wrist and pulled him back into the alley. His big eyes were stern as he looked Moto up and down.

"Why were you in that warehouse when it blew up?"

Moto winced. He knew these questions would be coming, and he knew he didn't have any great answers. "I was walking by the lake trying to clear my head. I was just passing by when I saw a bunch of thugs causing problems around the side of the warehouse. I tried to intervene and things got out of hand."

Keta stared without blinking as Moto spoke. He stared quietly for a few seconds longer, then shook his head and looked away. "You are lying. When I came looking for you, I overheard a women complaining about someone who sounded like you. For a bit of coin she told me you paid her for guidance to a warehouse on the Mud Docks. She said you were looking for someone."

Moto's stomach dropped. Not even a few hours and that woman was already running her mouth. There was no telling how far word might have spread. He would just have to hope the details were fuzzy enough and no one cared enough to connect the dots.

"I see by your face that you have no intention of telling me. If you cannot even be honest with me now, when I have caught you in the lie, then I suppose my words earlier were not too harsh after all." Keta turned to walk away.

Moto caught his arm and spun him back. Keta was on the verge of giving up on him. If he caught him in another lie, or thought Moto was holding something back, that would certainly be the end of things between them. But maybe if he knew what was going on. Maybe he might understand why Moto did the things he had to.

And after what happened at the warehouse, Moto would need an airtight story to avoid suspicion. Keta would have to know enough to go along.

Moto tried to convince himself it was that last reason that convinced him as the words spilled out. He didn't give every detail, but he left nothing out of the broad outline. Soundstealer massacred his village. He wanted revenge. He wanted to find whoever hired Soundstealer and make them pay. He thought this merchant might be that person.

Moto was honest about acknowledging his selfish motivation. He didn't think Keta would believe he was being completely altruistic. Not after recent events. But he tried to emphasize that he wanted to stop the attacks from happening to other villages. It _was_ true, even if it wasn't as important.

Moto scolded himself, worrying so much about stretching the truth to Keta. It didn't hurt the shapeling if Moto left out the harsher details.

Keta listened solemnly, asking questions occasionally. When Moto finished, the shapeling pulled him close and hugged him. "Thank you for telling the truth. It is not easy to share everything, like that." Moto winced over Keta's shoulder.

The shapeling stepped back, running his hands down Moto's arms and entwining their fingers as he looked up at him. "But you must let this desire for revenge go."

Moto had been expecting such a response. But at least the shapeling was looking at him with warmth again. He squeezed Keta's hands, more for himself than anything else. "If I just let this go, then Soundstealer will just keep hurting people. I'm being selfish, but that selfishness drives me to do something that's good for everyone."

"Hate cannot cure hate. Even if you manage to stop Soundstealer, vengeance will only perpetuate the cycle somewhere else. Imagine what Fumi will do if you betray her and attack her father. You see? Always somewhere else it crops up."

Moto wanted to sigh in exasperation, but he was too afraid to break the newfound reconciliation. He kept his voice level. "It's just hard for me to accept that. What you say *sounds* pleasing, but it has to do more than sound nice. You talk about the pain caused by acting in anger, but what about the pain caused by all the people who stand by and let bad people prosper because they don't want to dirty their hands? What happens to Fumi if we let Soundstealer continue to influence her?"

"I do not need to convince you now. It is enough for me to know that your actions are born from your heart, not a disregard for the people around you. What Soundstealer did was wrong, and I will help you stop him."

<MAKE THIS A BIT MORE BITTER OF A CONCLUSION TO SET UP LATER FIGHT>
<A BIT MORE DISCUSSION OF WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE DAGGERS IS>

Moto blinked. "You will?"

Keta smiled warmly. "I will. But we do not need to harden ourselves like Soundstealer. Even the darkest organization can be brought to the light if we stand for our ideals firmly enough. And if we can improve the conscience of the Daggers, they will bring justice to Soundstealer without the need for vengeance."

Moto thought for a moment. Keta was still hopelessly idealistic, but there might be the seed of a good idea buried beneath the idealism. If he could turn the opinion of the Daggers against Soundstealer, that might be enough to take him down.

It seemed like a long shot, but if it was a path that brought Keta along, he was willing to at least give it a try. Perhaps Keta would be more willing to accept the harsher realities if he saw they had tried their best to do things the honorable way.

"What about Fumi?"

Keta rubbed his chin. "I do not want to lie to Fumi. But... perhaps it is OK for a short time. If we can find something between this merchant and Soundstealer, it might help our case when we tell her."

Moto sighed, letting out some of the tension he had been holding. It wasn't ideal, but considering everything that had happened, it was probably the best he could have hoped for. He was happy that things were better with Keta, and that he would have someone to help in his goals.

He lead Keta by the hand back into the street, they had already been standing still for too long. "I don't suppose you'll let me kill the woman who told you where to find me?"

Keta looked at him in horror and Moto laughed. "Kidding! Mostly. Now, what's our cover story if anyone starts asking where we were?"

They rounded a corner on the rocky mountain trail and Iga came into view. The mountain village, strung across the narrow, isolated mountain spires, connected by rail carts, leapt into view suddenly, giving no warning beforehand on the treacherous, switch backed trail up the mountain. It was intentional, reinforcing the sense of awe people felt when they came to make a contract.

The trail ran through a vermillion torii gate before snaking along a raised walkway through the village's fields. The trail ended at the small village that supported the Dagger houses on the surrounding spires. Several of the villagers unbent from their work in the rice paddies, pulling back their conical straw hats to wave at Moto and the others as they reentered the village. A small smile crept to Moto's face as he returned the wave.

It was strange, feeling at home. Moto had spent two years in Koga as he prepared to take the Dagger exam, but he had never felt settled. He always left his bags packed, ready to move if he ever ran afoul of a particularly violent criminal in the Lurkwood. And he had never had friends or even acquaintances, really. When he wasn't training or working some job for money, he had been sleeping.

Moto shook his head as the group entered the village. Many of the shops had their storefronts open to catch the stiff mountain breeze that periodically found it's way around the large stone talons that surrounded most of the lower village. Everything seemed so normal. Besides the extreme location, there was nothing to suggest that Iga served the most deadly band of assassins and rogues in all of Yosai.

The village carpenter caught Fumi's attention and waved her over. She smiled, bouncing up to the woman with a smile and a laugh as she shared her latest exploits. Watching Fumi, Moto could almost see Keta's perspective. It was easy to imagine how this friendly interaction, and the happy villagers, had given Fumi a conscience. And how that perspective could spread if you held to it firmly.

But none of the senior Daggers walked about the village. The problem with inspiring change was that the only people you could reach were those who had a reason to want to change. By definition it was all the people who weren't in power.

Fumi's story managed to last the entire time the rest of the group was unloading their packs, returning equipment to the nearby shop keepers and paying them some of the contract fee. As usual, she reappeared once the grunt work was done.

"Nice work team! Can't wait for the next one." Fumi held out a hand for her portion of the contract fee with a smile.

Iruka counted out Fumi's share and dropped the gold into her outstretched hand. "You might have to wait a while, kid."

Keta paused as he was lifting his lightened pack back onto his shoulder. "Why is that?"

"What do you mean why? Suddenly I've gotta have a reason? I'm a jonin, I do what I want!" Iruka leaned forward and flicked Keta's forehead. "I've got books to read and other genin to torture. I mean to enjoy my hard-earned seniority, not grind myself to the bone playing chaperone to a bunch of overeager baby Daggers."

Keta stepped back, rubbing his forehead with an air of dignity. Fumi's face dropped into a pout behind him. Iruka chuckled. "Only teasing. I'm not sick of you just yet." She jerked a thumb in the direction of the Gearhouse standing against the rock wall at the far edge of town. "When I was picking up this contract, I saw that the last batch of your recruits was out on their first mission."

Fumi gasped, clutching her hands to her mouth. "Really?! So soon! Why didn't you tell us? I haven't started preparing at all!"

Moto and Keta shared a look of confusion. "What's the big deal?"

Fumi threw her hands out to the side. "What's the big deal? It means the chunin exam is starting soon! And I haven't been learning any exciting new moves. What am I going to show off?"

"Calm down kid, you've probably got a week or two until the last squad is back. Plenty of time to learn some new tricks. For the two of you who are clearly lost, once all of the new recruits have completed their first mission, we hold a contest. Those who do well in the contest are raised to chunin level."

Moto felt a pleasant thrill of surprise. Chunin were considered full Daggers. They no longer needed supervision anywhere accept the jonin training ground and they had access to a wider range of more dangerous missions. "I didn't think we'd be able to advance so quickly."

Iruka gave a disapproving grunt. "The Daggers do not tolerate rookies for very long. They don't want you getting comfortable. But don't get too excited. It's up or out. Anyone who fails the exam joins the lower village or leaves, so you should take preparation seriously." Iruka looked at Fumi with her final line.

Keta smiled. "Will it be like the obstacle course? I look forward to another performance."

Iruka rolled her eyes. "Yeah, there will be a crowd. You'll compete in your squads at first, then individually, so I recommend you practice both. I can't say too much more though."

Try as they might, they couldn't get Iruka to share any more details. She seemed to enjoy their frustration, even as she warned them to take the event seriously. Eventually, they gave up and all started back towards their houses to drop off their things. Moto and Iruka walked towards Terran together.

Iruka was watching him out of the corner of her eye. "Seems like you and Keta made up."

Moto shifted the strap on his pack uncomfortably. "Yeah... what about it?"

Iruka pulled against his pack with her power, causing him to spin and stumble. "I'm just happy for you, idiot. Not everybody has ulterior motives." They walked in silence for a minute before Iruka continued. "He's good for you, I think."

Moto blushed, looking away from her. Why was Iruka so interested in his love life?

"You're gonna have a choice soon, kid."

"What do you mean?"

"The chunin exam is when the senior Daggers really start to take notice. Some might have taken an interest during the obstacle course, but now is when they can actually start recruiting."

"So?"

"_So_ it means people might ask you to join their squad. There will be two kinds of offers after the exam. Jonin who want to start their own squad will be looking for entire teams that they can take over. And then existing squads will just be trying to fill one or two empty slots.

"The existing squads will be more intense. They'll have existing contracts and more senior members. In terms of pure ambition, getting onto one of them early is a good step. But it's a tough life."

"You don't think I should do it if I get the chance."

Iruka tossed her hands up. "I don't care either way. Dumb as you are, you're a big boy who has to make his own decisions." She walked for a second in silence, then carried on. "I know this is going to bug you, which is why I'm saying it, but you remind me of myself when I was new. I chose to join a senior squad then. I don't think I would again."

Surprisingly, it _didn't_ bother Moto when Iruka said he was like her. Moto chided himself. Another attachment affecting his decision making. "But you liked that squad until Soundstealer left and Sugi..."

"Got himself killed. Yeah, I did. But at the top, there's only one thing that really matters. Results. I'm not saying you won't find things you like up there, but it's precarious. Once you buy into that mindset, everything in your life is contingent on doing more, faster, better. There's no room to breathe. If you try to step back and enjoy what you've built, you'll just get left behind."

"Only if I can't keep up."

Iruka barked a surprised laugh, then shook her head. "Honestly it's like talking to a mirror. Except it's a stupid mirror that shows you how clueless you were as a kid." She messed his hair and Moto pulled back, waving his hands. "I know I can't convince you. But just... think about what your life was like back in Koga, and think of what it's like now with Fumi and Keta."

"I can still spend time with them, even if I join another squad."

"Sure. But what do you think you'll do when everyone on your squad is jonin, spending every waking minute training or making political moves. Do you really think you'll be OK just being worse than them? Knowing that you _could_ catch up if you made the same sacrifices?"

"No. I'd probably join them in training. But what are you saying? I should just give up on having ambition?"

"Sort of. You're lucky, kid. Keta and Fumi are strong. You'll probably go far even if you do choose friends over a more prestigious position. The important difference is priorities. If you put achievement in the top spot, if you insist on never missing an opportunity and always pushing for perfection, it won't leave room for anything else. No matter how hard you try, the sacrifices will sneak in. You'll wind up dead, or lonely, or both."

<br />

Moto leaned against a boulder at the edge of the lake in the Playground. Daggers darted above his head, running across the tethers that stretched from wall to wall amidst the soaring ceilings. The air was filled with shouts as team members called to one another in their training. Periodic cracks and thuds punctuated the voices as powerful new moves were honed amidst the trees and rock pillars of the main floor. The smell of sweat and dust filled the warm air.

Keta and Fumi stood together on the opposite side of the lake with their heads close together in discussion. Fumi's hair was plastered to her head, dripping with water from the lake. The two of them nodded as they stepped apart. Keta dropped into a crouch and held out his hand. Fumi rolled her shoulders, then gripped his wrist.

Keta's muscles flared. His heals dug into the hard packed earth as he spun, dragging Fumi along. Fumi lifted her feet and shot a blast of wind from her free hand, adding speed to the rotation. The two became a blur.

Moto reached backwards with his power, grabbing hold of the dog sized stone behind him. His back pressed into the boulder he leaned against as he hurled the stone forward, racing across the surface of the lake directly toward the other two.

With a final grunt of exertion, Keta launched Fumi toward the stone faster than an arrow. At the last moment she flipped, thrusting her feet forward and shooting a condensed blast of wind into the flying rock. A shockwave ripped out from the force of the collision, distorting the surface of the water into a bowl beneath Fumi.

The stone cracked but did not break. It deflected upward, glancing off Fumi's wind blast and flying into the distance. Her momentum absorbed by the collision, Fumi fell to the water, skipping once before she sank below the surface. She reappeared a moment later, wiping water from her eyes.

"The blast still isn't concentrated enough!" She started swimming back towards Keta.

Moto's mind wandered as he waited for the other two to reset for another try. He had plenty of boulders left to launch.

As they had for the last two days, his thoughts drifted to Iruka and Keta. His mouth turned down in a frown.

It was easy enough for them to criticize. Iruka had spent her early years doing exactly what Moto had. Now she preached taking it easy, but the only reason she was able to do that was because she'd made it high in the ranks first.

And Keta. Keta would be _dead_ if he had his way. Moto shook his head angrily. The people who spoke nobly always looked down their nose at the people who actually saw the world as it was. Never mind that lofty ideals weren't what got things done.

He didn't disagree with what they were saying. Not necessarily. Their ideas were fine most of the time. But when things got _hard_, when you had to make tradeoffs, you had to be willing to do the hard things. They acted like his pragmatism meant he _wanted_ to be heartless.

But his parents had died. He had spent three years of his life killing himself to get here. What was the point of all that if he just let things go and lived the easy life? What was the point of that if he died pointlessly trying to pull some thug out of a burning building? What was the point if he didn't _do something_ with his life? And nothing got done by taking it easy or shackling yourself to inflexible ideals.

No matter what squad he chose, he could die at any time. Everything could be lost without warning. He needed more power. More control. So he could protect the people he cared about like Keta and Iruka. So he could stop people like Soundstealer from taking them away from him.

And yet, he was happy for the first time in a long time. It would be so easy to do what Iruka said. To have friends and do what felt right, instead of making the hard choices that were best in the long run. Keta even said he would help with Soundstealer. Maybe that was enough.

A pulse in the gravity from behind pulled him out of his thoughts. While he helped Keta and Fumi train, Moto was keeping his gravity sense active. Since using it in the cave, constant practice had made the sense almost second nature. A little more practice and he thought he'd be able to keep it up subconsciously, even while actively focused on other things.

"That's a powerful move. Do you mean it as a shield breaker?"

Moto gave a start as though he hadn't expected the squad of young Daggers to come walking around the boulder. No need to advertise his new senses right before a major competition. "More or less."

The trio were all new recruits. Moto recognized the one on the left as a fellow member of Terran house. A slender boy in his late teens. With short black hair, delicate features, and a small mouth and nose, he didn't really look like a brawler, but the boy was a stone-eater so he likely specialized in close combat.

On the right was a tall girl with blocky features and a thick scar running down her left cheek and neck. The sides of her head were shaved, with long, salt-and-pepper hair on top that fell to the side. Her large frame was well-muscled, yet somehow she moved the most quietly of the group, like a large cat. Moto had seen her sharing a cart with Keta on their way to Ignis, so she was some sort of flame resonant.

In the middle was a tall, gangly looking boy with big hands and feet as though he was still growing into his height. He had the same black and white hair, held in a long ponytail, and blocky features as the girl. They both had the look of northerners. Though he was the youngest, the boy seemed to be the squad's leader.

They were three of the quieter recruits. Moto struggled to remember any of their names. After a moment he recalled the stone-eater was Haiyu and the young boy was Hako. He couldn't remember the girl's name.

Hako pushed the his circular glasses back up his nose with an over-large hand. "Interesting. It solves your speed problem at the same time as it gives you a more versatile first strike. Very creative."

Moto blinked, then narrowed his eyes suspiciously. The move had been his idea. Keta's strength and speed made him good at closing with enemies and breaking through defenses. But that required him to move fast so he wasn't exposed to attacks while he got close. Too fast for Moto or Fumi to match, which meant Keta spent a lot of time outnumbered as they caught up. Keta didn't mind the solo attention, but it was bad strategy.

Meanwhile, it was hard for Fumi to keep her wind attacks focused at a distance. This move helped her close the distance quickly. Her wind gave her more options to block projectiles and disrupt the enemy than Keta's hand to hand style. It also made Keta's speed an asset, helping him catch up and support Fumi quickly.

Had Hako been watching them train? Or had he put things together that quickly just based off their powers and seeing the move once? The boy smiled, giving off an air of earnest curiosity. He didn't seem like the person to go sneaking around spying on others. Of course, the best thieves never gave a sign until they'd robbed you of all their coin.

"I'm not sure what you mean. We were just using it to strengthen Fumi's wind." No need to confirm the boy's guess. "Are you all training for the exams now too?"

Hako nodded. "We got back from our first mission a week and a half. Luckily, our first mission was nearby and brief, so we've had a good amount of time to prepare. Not like you three, I hear you've been busy."

Fumi waved her hands and shouted from the other side of the lake. "What are you waiting for? Give us another throw!"

Moto gestured at the squad and Fumi brought Keta over. She nodded to each of the newcomers, water dripping from her nose as she greeted them each by name without hesitation. Fumi was good at remembering people's names.

Keta nodded to the tall girl, whose name was Hibana. Moto nearly jumped. Hibana had stepped back into the shadow cast by the boulder. He had almost forgotten she was there she stood so still.

"Are you sure we need to practice this Moto? It's so frustrating! I don't see why we can't just leave it to Keta to strike first."

Moto groaned internally as Fumi gave truth to his lie from earlier, but Hako's face didn't seem to change. "It seems like a good idea to me. But things would probably be easier if you struck the rock more than once."

Hako held out his hand and a thin stream of water materialized and snaked through the air until it connected to Fumi. The stream of water thickened as it siphoned the liquid from Fumi into a swirling ball between the boy's hands and leaving her clothes.

Hako spun, shooting the water in three jets that hardened to spears of ice. The first spear found a crack in one of Moto's boulders and the other two spears followed up, striking new cracks that appeared from the first blow. With a _crack_, the boulder fell into pieces.

"Woah. Thanks for the tip, Hako!"

Hako nodded demurely, happy to have helped. "Of course. I was just telling Moto how we've had a bit more time to practice with our abilities, so we've had a chance to learn some tricks like that. But you've probably learned more useful things out on your missions. Keta, haven't you been on _three_ already? That's amazing."

Keta nodded graciously, a satisfied smile at the corner of his mouth. Fumi frowned at Moto, still aggrieved about how Moto cost her a win in the obstacle course. If not for him, that would have been her praise to bask in.

Hako continued, though his eyes darted between the two of them. It was hard to tell what he made of the interaction, but Moto was sure he had caught it. "You three are definitely going to be favorites to win the exam. Did you really go on a mission for Soundstealer?"

Fumi beamed as she nodded proudly.

"What was it like?" Hako's face never lost that shine of simple curiosity. But the hairs on the back of Moto's neck stood up. He seemed too eager. And the pair behind him were watching intently as well.

Fumi's voice took on it's storytelling tone. "It was deadly! There were these giant spiders holding a boy captive in a creepy cave. Moto and Keta snuck in first to find the kid, but they were discovered. Iruka and I had to come charging in to break them out!"

"You mean jorogumo? What was the fight like?"

Moto realized why the group was making him uncomfortable. They should have all been looking at Fumi while she spoke, but each one in the trio was looking at a different member of Moto's squad. They weren't here for a friendly chat. They were here to observe and gather information.

Moto cut in over Fumi before she could continue. "I think we've taken a long enough break. We should get back to practicing."

Fumi looked at him with frustration. "You're the one who made us stop! I was in the middle of my story!"

Hako nodded, eyes on Moto. Was there a gleam in his eye? "Of course. We'll let you all get back to practicing. I didn't mean to distract."

The trio said their goodbyes and left, but Moto wondered if they would be watching from afar.

"What was that about? I didn't get to tell any of the good parts!"

"I don't think they were here to talk. I think they were researching us." As he watched them go, Moto wondered what information they had given away.
