The wind was like an antsy child. It tugged at Denri's clothes, flapping them against her shivering frame. It groaned as it blew though the village, eager to break free of the boring, ramshackle huts and go tumbling, frolicking down the steep mountain hillside. It never seemed to tire.

The tengu residents had long ago adapted. They walked easily at a half-falling angle that kept the wind's tireless enthusiasm in check. Sadly, the trick took longer than two months to learn.

Denri yelped as a strong gust blew her several feet to the right. She mourned the loss of her dignity as her arms pinwheeled through the air. She managed to plant her feet and lower her center of gravity before the gust blew her completely out of the training ring.

Hattori turned to face her from the center of the ring, leaning back against the wind and holding a staff defensively in his hands. Hands that had existed for only a month. 

The tengu's body was still going through changes from Aki's awakening touch. His wings had shrunk down, the feathers thinning out and flattening against the skin to reveal arms like a human. The feathers on Hattori's arms and head were now completely white, with a large patch of alabaster feathers spreading down his chest as well. But his expression still remained alien and unreadable to Denri.

_Are you OK?_

The feeling of Hattori's voice in her mind was still unnatural to Denri. She made a face and thought something rude back at him.

_I do not understand why you keep doing that. You know I can only project my thoughts. I cannot hear you._

"If that's true how did you know I was thinking anything at you? Hmm?"

_You were standing there silently and moving your face as though you were speaking to me._

Denri remained skeptical.

"Stay focused." Eizo stood at the edge of the ring, his arms crossed behind his back. The tall man was still thin, but his frame was regaining muscle quickly. "Denri, keep your stance balanced. When the wind blows you like that, it is telling you that you have overextended."

Denri sighed and raised her triple staff. She held one of the forearm-length metal rods in each hand. A third rod hung between, suspended by a short chain connecting it to the ends of the two rods in her hands. "Learning martial arts on top of a mountain in the middle of the wilderness and somehow these two make it boring _and_ annoying." Denri kept her voice quiet. Eizo was teaching at her request, after all.

She advanced towards Hattori carefully, trying to keep all of Eizo's lessons in mind at once as she moved. It felt like an impossible task, but Denri forced herself to focus. She refused to let the wilderness shrink her back to a helpless, scared kid. She needed to get stronger.

The tengu held his staff with both hands at one end, extending his reach as he brought the weapon down towards Denri's shoulder. Denri deflected the blow with one of her rods and pivoted. As her body turned sideways, she swung the other rod around towards his arm. Hattori brought the end of his staff up, deflecting the blow awkwardly as he shuffled his taloned feet backwards.

Denri pressed her advantage, moving forward as she rained blows down on both sides. Hattori matched her, flicking his staff from side to side as he blocked Denri's attacks. The intensity of her attacks increased as she grew frustrated by the expressionless avian face staring back at her.

Denri made a feint towards Hattori's head, then pulled up short as the tengu tried to block and swung towards his stomach with the other rod. She sent a pulse of energy into the metal. There was a bright flash as the metal connected with Hattori's side and a spark discharged. Hattori grunted, his muscles spasming reflexively. He managed to keep moving, but the movements on that side of his body were slower and less coordinated. Denri still couldn't muster much of an electrical charge, but it was enough to leave muscles numb.

Denri dropped both ends of the triple staff and grabbed its center in one hand. She planted the other hand on the ground and sent a low, sweeping kick towards Hattori's legs. Electricity trailed from Denri's ankle as it moved. Hattori jumped backwards to avoid the blow, landing off balance.

Denri followed through with her kick, spinning as she swung the triple staff around. The weapon snapped straight as momentum pushed the end rods out. Denri shifted mid-spin, reappearing behind Hattori. Denri flared the staff with electricity.

Before she shifted, Denri had been leaning forward against the wind, but now the wind was suddenly behind her. Her swing faltered and she went tumbling forward into Hattori's back, sending them both sprawling to the ground.

Denri looked anywhere but Eizo as she disentangled herself from the mass of rumpled feathers that broke her fall. She didn't bother offering a hand to Hattori.

"Denri, your movements are fluid and you clearly have a natural flare for offense. But you try too hard to _break_ your opponent's guard. Focus on remaining grounded in your stance. If you offer no weakness, eventually an enemy will show you theirs."

"I know, I know. I just get carried away."

Eizo turned towards the tengu and stroked his chin. "Hattori, we may need to rethink your weapon choice. A two handed staff limits the mobility and range that you could have with your wings."

_The staff is the sacred weapon of my people. All daitengu use one._

"But daitengu have wings on their back, allowing them to fly while they fight. Your situation is more limited." Hattori's grip tightened on the staff and he pulled it towards his chest. Eizo's face softened. "I know it's not exactly what you wanted. But you've got a chance to become something completely new."

_I do not want to *be* something completely new._
