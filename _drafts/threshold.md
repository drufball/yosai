The wind was like an antsy child. It tugged at Denri's clothes, flapping them against her shivering frame. It groaned as it blew though the village, eager to break free of the boring, ramshackle huts and go tumbling, frolicking down the steep mountain hillside. It never seemed to tire.

The tengu residents had long ago adapted. They walked easily at a half-falling angle that kept the wind's tireless enthusiasm in check. Sadly, the trick took longer than two months to learn.

Denri yelped as a strong gust blew her several feet to the right. She mourned the loss of her dignity as her arms pinwheeled through the air. She managed to plant her feet and lower her center of gravity before the gust blew her completely out of the training ring.

Hattori turned to face her from the center of the ring, leaning back against the wind and holding a staff defensively in his hands. Hands that had existed for only a month. 

The tengu's body was still going through changes from Aki's awakening touch. His wings had shrunk down, the feathers thinning out and flattening against the skin to reveal arms like a human. The feathers on Hattori's arms and head were now completely white, with a large patch of alabaster feathers spreading down his chest as well. But his expression still remained alien and unreadable to Denri.

_Are you OK?_

The feeling of Hattori's voice in her mind was still unnatural to Denri. She made a face and thought something rude back at him.

_I do not understand why you keep doing that. You know I can only project my thoughts. I cannot hear you._

"If that's true how did you know I was thinking anything at you? Hmm?"

_You stood silently and your face moved as though you were speaking to me._

Denri remained skeptical.

"Stay focused." Eizo stood at the edge of the ring, his arms crossed behind his back. He was still thin, but his large frame was regaining muscle quickly. "Denri, keep your stance balanced. When the wind blows you like that, it is telling you that you have overextended."

Denri sighed and raised her triple staff. She held one of the forearm-length metal rods in each hand. A third rod hung between, suspended by a short chain connecting it to the ends of the two rods in her hands. "Learning martial arts on top of a mountain in the middle of the wilderness and somehow these two make it boring _and_ annoying." Denri kept her voice quiet. Eizo was teaching at her request, after all.

She advanced towards Hattori carefully, trying to keep all of Eizo's lessons in mind at once as she moved. It felt like an impossible task, but Denri forced herself to focus. She refused to let the wilderness shrink her back to a helpless, scared kid. She needed to get stronger.

The tengu held his staff with both hands at one end, extending his reach as he brought the weapon down towards Denri's shoulder. Denri deflected the blow with one of her rods and pivoted. As her body turned sideways, she swung the other rod around towards his arm. Hattori brought the end of his staff up, deflecting the blow awkwardly as he shuffled his taloned feet backwards.

Denri pressed her advantage, moving forward as she rained blows down on both sides. Hattori matched her, flicking his staff from side to side as he blocked Denri's attacks. Her strikes grew wilder as she grew frustrated by the expressionless avian face staring back at her.

Denri made a feint towards Hattori's head, then pulled up short as the tengu tried to block and swung towards his stomach with the other rod. She sent a pulse of energy into the metal. There was a bright flash as the metal connected with Hattori's side and a spark discharged. Hattori grunted, his muscles spasming reflexively. He managed to keep going, but the movements on that side of his body were slower and less coordinated. Denri still couldn't muster much of an electrical charge, but it was enough to leave muscles numb.

Denri dropped both ends of the triple staff and grabbed its center in one hand. She planted the other hand on the ground and sent a low, sweeping kick towards Hattori's legs. Electricity trailed from Denri's ankle as it moved. Hattori jumped backwards to avoid the blow, landing off balance.

Denri followed through with her kick, spinning as she swung the triple staff behind her back. The weapon snapped straight as momentum pushed the end rods out. Denri shifted mid-spin, reappearing behind Hattori in a flash of sparks.

Before she shifted, Denri had been leaning forward against the wind, but now the wind was suddenly behind her. Her swing faltered and she went tumbling forward into Hattori's back, sending them both sprawling to the ground.

Denri looked anywhere but Eizo as she disentangled herself from the mass of rumpled feathers that broke her fall. She didn't bother offering a hand to Hattori.

"Denri, your movements are fluid and you clearly have a natural flare for offense. But you try too hard to _break_ your opponent's guard. Focus on remaining grounded in your stance. If you offer no weakness, eventually an enemy will show you theirs."

"I know, I know. I just get carried away."

Eizo turned towards the tengu and stroked his chin. "Hattori, we may need to rethink your weapon choice. A two handed staff limits the mobility and range that you could have with your wings."

Hattori planted the staff in the ground, jangling the four rings at the top. _This staff is the sacred weapon of my people. All daitengu use one._

"But daitengu have wings on their back, allowing them to fly while they hold the weapon. Your situation is more limited." Hattori's grip tightened on the staff and he pulled it towards his chest. Eizo's face softened. "I know it's not exactly what you wanted. But you've got a chance to become something completely new."

_I do not want to *be* something completely new._

The hut's walls rattled in the wind. After two months living in the tengu village, Denri could almost tune it out. 

She sat on her straw bed with legs crossed and body hunched over a flat chunk of stone. A single torch filled the small space with flickering light. Her bundle of colored chalks lay unfurled on the bed beside her. She held a stick of white in her hands as she made a series of delicate marks against the stone, her face set in a mask of concentration.

The once empty room was now filled with decorated stones. Some were covered with pleasing patterns of color. Others depicted stick figure scenes of dubious artistic quality. Nearly all were vulgar in some way.

Shiri's head perked up from the bed and he looked towards the door. Denri paused from her drawing and looked to Onara, who lay across the room on a throne of dirty clothes. She was looking at the door as well.

A few minutes later, there was a knock and a whisper at the door. Denri called Aki inside.

"That had to be at least 5 minutes. I think that's the furthest they've ever sensed you."

Aki eased the door shut and turned into the room. She beamed. "I've been practicing! I told them I was coming when I left my room. I wasn't sure if the range was still too far for me though. Neither one of these two is good about responding." Aki stuck her tongue out at Onara, then flopped onto the bed next to Denri and pulled Shiri into her lap. She kicked her feet against the edge of the bed with the sort of frenetic energy that only a small child with a secret can muster.

It gave Denri a momentary sense of vertigo. She had to remind herself that Aki was in fact a very young child. 

Ever since she awakened Hattori, Aki's body had been growing noticeably. The girl was now taller than Denri, with a body approaching that of a teenager. The large vertical slash that stood where her right eye had been only served to make her look older.

"What's got you so excited?"

"I learned a new trick!"

"Yeah? What is it?"

Aki wiggled and squirmed on the bed, jostling Shiri to and fro. The cat looked at her sideways, indignation writ over his face. "I don't wanna tell you I wanna show you!"

"All right, all right. Can you contain yourself for a few minutes while I finish this drawing? Or are you gonna keep bouncing my cat until he pukes on my bed?" Aki bobbed her head up and down in a decidedly unrestrained way. But she did her best to hold still. Somehow that only raised the frenetic tension in the room.

After a few minutes, Denri felt Aki's chin rest on her shoulder. "What're you drawing?"

Denri shooed her away. "I can't finish with you flopping all over me! Artists need space, you know."

Denri made a few dramatic flicks of her wrist as she put the finishing touches to her work. Then she lifted the stone and turned it towards Aki with a healthy dose of pride. The dark stone depicted a tall lanky stick figure with scraggly hair that looked passingly like Eizo. He stood beneath a tree, a stern frown on his face. Hattori sat in the branches above him. A white glob was in freefall from Hattori's butt to Eizo's head.

Aki giggled. "Are you two getting along better?"

Denri hefted the stone and placed it along the wall with the rest of her masterpieces. "Define better. I hit him in the face a couple times today. That's better than usual."

"Denri!"

"You asked!"

Aki shook her head. "You should be nicer to him."

"Hey, I talk to him and train with him and I'm not arguing to kill him anymore, right? He'll get nice Denri when he proves he deserves her. I thought you wanted to show me a new trick or something. Let's get back to that part."

Aki made a huff a moment longer, but Denri held firm. Aki was excited about this new trick of hers. Denri knew she'd break first.

"Alright, alright!" A grin broke out across Aki's face. She leaned in towards Denri and lowered her voice to a whisper. "Do you wanna pull a prank with me?"

Denri looked at Aki seriously, her face dark. "Aki. You came here to pull a prank?"

Aki sat back, caught off guard by Denri's response. "We don't have to! I just thought I could show you my new--."

"And you let us waste all this time drawing on rocks and talking about Hattori? Lead with the fun stuff next time!" Denri clapped her hands and rubbed them together hungrily. "What did you have in mind? Should I bring my chalk?"

The mountaintop was dark at night. Lanterns stood no chance against the wind, so the only light came from behind closed doors and boarded windows. Aki and Denri crouched in the darkness and leaning against the rough stone of the mountain. Eizo's hut sat before them, huddled against the cliff face that marked the highest point of the village. There were only a handful of buildings higher up. Eizo's desertion of Ninigi's Blades and Aki's unexplained powers to awaken tengu had earned them an honored spot.

Denri elbowed Aki. "Does he know you're gone?"

Aki nodded. "I told him I was going to see you."

Denri threw her head back and groaned. "Aki! You have so much to learn. He's totally going to be on alert if he knows you're with me. Next time tell him you have to poop or something." Aki looked towards the ground, her shoulders slumping. "No, no, don't give me any of that 'I'm adorable and you made me sad' crap. It's fine, we'll work something out. Where does he keep the journal?"

"It's always beside his bed at the back of the room."

"Alright, then I'll climb up on the rock so I can slip in one of the side windows. Can you keep him focused on the front of the hut until I grab the notebook?" Aki nodded. "Great. I'll grab the book while he's not looking, we run like mad, then we work some artistic magic all over the front cover. Easy. Wait until I get into position."

Denri peeled off from Aki, her night vision letting her pick her way across the surface of loose rocks without making a sound. When she got near the house, Denri took a few quick steps and launched herself toward the cliff wall. She caught a handhold and swung herself further up. There was a window set into the hut's wall where it met the cliff face and was shielded from the wind. Denri scrambled up to it and turned to give Aki a thumbs up. Now to see whatever new trick Aki had cooked up.

Aki returned the thumbs up, then placed her hands along the ground. She seemed to strain for a moment. Then her skin darkened and rippled. Her body shrank and a tail sprouted from her back. Denri blinked and Aki was replaced by a perfect replica of Onara.

Denri almost whistled in appreciation, then remembered where she was. She looked through the window as cat-Aki stalked towards the front door. Eizo was sitting in his underwear at a small desk, diligently repairing a hole in his pants. Denri felt only a flash of jealousy that Eizo and Aki got furniture in their house. She reserved the rest of her mental faculties to memorize Eizo's current appearance. She was going to need an exceptionally nice rock to memorialize the scene.

The door swung open slightly as Aki pressed her feline head against the door. Eizo looked up at the sound.

"Oh no." He stood up and started backing away from the door. Aki meowed and started walking towards him. "What do you want? I don't have any food." Eizo nearly jumped out of his skin as he backed into a low wooden stool. He grabbed his chest. "I thought the other one had snuck in too." Aki meowed again. The girl was relentless. Denri used the moment of distraction to ease the window open. It was hard to work while clamping a hand over her mouth to stop the giggles.

Eizo reached his bed and sat down heavily upon it. He threw his pants at the cat in a final defense. "There! You can sleep on those. They smell like me." Aki stepped over the pants and jumped onto the bed. Denri slid through the window as Aki curled in Eizo's lap. He winced as she kneaded his bare legs with her claws "Denri let you out to torment me, didn't she?" He placed a resigned hand on the cat's back and began to pet it. 

Denri turned her attention to the small table by Eizo's bedside. How much extra furniture did these two need? Honestly. A small leather book laid on top of the table. Eizo sat with his back to it. Denri snuck forward, bare feet moving soundlessly across the floor. She reached the table and probed her arm forward.

Eizo's hand darted backwards, catching Denri's in a grip like iron. She yelped involuntarily in surprise. "May I help you?"

"Oh, you know. Just looking around for Onara. Have you seen her lately?" The cat in Eizo's lap stood and tried to slink away, head and tail drooping. Eizo caught the cat by the scruff of the neck. "Oh look, you found her! Good thing I came looking here first. Ha ha ha."

Eizo held the cat to his face. "I assume this is not Onara then. Aki?" The cat meowed piteously. Eizo gave it a shake. "Aki." The cat grew in Eizo's hand until he was depositing Aki onto the bed next to him.

"How did you know it was me?" She looked at the floor, prepared for a berating.

"You did not scratch me when I reached back for Denri and disturbed you in my lap. What were you two trying to do?" 

Denri tried to catch Aki's eye and signal to stay cool, but Aki spilled the beans immediately. "We were going to steal your notebook and draw funny things all over it." 

Eizo gave Aki a stern look. "I understand something like this from her, but I expected better of you."

"Hey!"

"I'm sorry." Aki looked miserable. "I just wanted to show Denri my new trick."

Eizo moved his hand to Aki's shoulder. He still held Denri like a vice. She wondered if she would have to chew through her wrist to get free. "It was a very impressive trick. You're getting stronger every day." Eizo turned towards Denri. "You both are."

Aki brightened. "We are! Do you think the sage will let us leave soon then?"

Eizo nodded. "Once she's certain we can take care of ourselves and avoid getting caught."

"Good, because we need to leave as soon as possible!"

Eizo mussed up Aki's hair. "And why is that."

The girl shook her head, fighting off his hand. "Because we don't have much time if we want to win the Tournament!"

Eizo and Denri both looked at Aki askance. "Say that again?"

"We should join the Tournament!"

Eizo looked at Aki sternly. "Aki, we need to stay in hiding. We can't do something public like join the Tournament."

"Sure we can! We could just use made up names so no one knows who we are. And if we win, then the gods have to give us a place where no one could bug us. Hattori and the other tengu could come live with us too!"

Denri thought for a moment. "You know, it might not actually be that crazy of an idea." Eizo's head whipped around to face her, looking betrayed. "No, really. If we're in the tournament, then in theory no one can mess with us, right? Or at least, the gods and other champions have to offer us a reasonable challenge before they can attack us. And if we win they would have to leave us alone."

"What's your point?"

"You've pissed off a god and at least one champion by deserting. And whatever is going on with Aki, there's got to be people of a similar level behind it. What I'm saying is that I'd rather deal with those people in a series of well-structured challenges that we have a chance of responding to. As opposed to, you know, just getting assassinated in our sleep."
