The wind was like an antsy child. It tugged at Denri's clothes, flapping them against her shivering frame. It groaned as it blew though the village, eager to break free of the boring, ramshackle huts and go tumbling, frolicking down the steep mountain hillside. It never seemed to tire.

The tengu residents had long ago adapted. They walked easily at a half-falling angle that kept the wind's tireless enthusiasm in check. Sadly, the trick took longer than two months to learn.

Denri yelped as a strong gust blew her several feet to the right. She mourned the loss of her dignity as her arms pinwheeled through the air. She managed to plant her feet and lower her center of gravity before the gust blew her completely out of the training ring.

Hattori turned to face her from the center of the ring, leaning back against the wind and holding a staff defensively in his hands. Hands that had existed for only a month. 

The tengu's body was still going through changes from Aki's awakening touch. His wings had shrunk down, the feathers thinning out and flattening against the skin to reveal arms like a human. The feathers on Hattori's arms and head were now completely white, with a large patch of alabaster feathers spreading down his chest as well. But his expression still remained alien and unreadable to Denri.

_Are you OK?_

The feeling of Hattori's voice in her mind was still unnatural to Denri. She made a face and thought something rude back at him.

_I do not understand why you keep doing that. You know I can only project my thoughts. I cannot hear you._

"If that's true how did you know I was thinking anything at you? Hmm?"

_You stood silently and your face moved as though you were speaking to me._

Denri remained skeptical.

"Stay focused." Eizo stood at the edge of the ring, his arms crossed behind his back. He was still thin, but his large frame was regaining muscle quickly. "Denri, keep your stance balanced. When the wind blows you like that, it is telling you that you have overextended."

Denri sighed and raised her triple staff. She held one of the forearm-length metal rods in each hand. A third rod hung between, suspended by a short chain connecting it to the ends of the two rods in her hands. "Learning martial arts on top of a mountain in the middle of the wilderness and somehow these two make it boring _and_ annoying." Denri kept her voice quiet. Eizo was teaching at her request, after all.

She advanced towards Hattori carefully, trying to keep all of Eizo's lessons in mind at once as she moved. It felt like an impossible task, but Denri forced herself to focus. She refused to let the wilderness shrink her back to a helpless, scared kid. She needed to get stronger.

The tengu held his staff with both hands at one end, extending his reach as he brought the weapon down towards Denri's shoulder. Denri deflected the blow with one of her rods and pivoted. As her body turned sideways, she swung the other rod around towards his arm. Hattori brought the end of his staff up, deflecting the blow awkwardly as he shuffled his taloned feet backwards.

Denri pressed her advantage, moving forward as she rained blows down on both sides. Hattori matched her, flicking his staff from side to side as he blocked Denri's attacks. Her strikes grew wilder as she grew frustrated by the expressionless avian face staring back at her.

Denri made a feint towards Hattori's head, then pulled up short as the tengu tried to block and swung towards his stomach with the other rod. She sent a pulse of energy into the metal. There was a bright flash as the metal connected with Hattori's side and a spark discharged. Hattori grunted, his muscles spasming reflexively. He managed to keep going, but the movements on that side of his body were slower and less coordinated. Denri still couldn't muster much of an electrical charge, but it was enough to leave muscles numb.

Denri dropped both ends of the triple staff and grabbed its center in one hand. She planted the other hand on the ground and sent a low, sweeping kick towards Hattori's legs. Electricity trailed from Denri's ankle as it moved. Hattori jumped backwards to avoid the blow, landing off balance.

Denri followed through with her kick, spinning as she swung the triple staff behind her back. The weapon snapped straight as momentum pushed the end rods out. Denri shifted mid-spin, reappearing behind Hattori in a flash of sparks.

Before she shifted, Denri had been leaning forward against the wind, but now the wind was suddenly behind her. Her swing faltered and she went tumbling forward into Hattori's back, sending them both sprawling to the ground.

Denri looked anywhere but Eizo as she disentangled herself from the mass of rumpled feathers that broke her fall. She didn't bother offering a hand to Hattori.

"Denri, your movements are fluid and you clearly have a natural flare for offense. But you try too hard to _break_ your opponent's guard. Focus on remaining grounded in your stance. If you offer no weakness, eventually an enemy will show you theirs."

"I know, I know. I just get carried away."

Eizo turned towards the tengu and stroked his chin. "Hattori, we may need to rethink your weapon choice. A two handed staff limits the mobility and range that you could have with your wings."

Hattori planted the staff in the ground, jangling the four rings at the top. _This staff is the sacred weapon of my people. All daitengu use one._

"But daitengu have wings on their back, allowing them to fly while they hold the weapon. Your situation is more limited." Hattori's grip tightened on the staff and he pulled it towards his chest. Eizo's face softened. "I know it's not exactly what you wanted. But you've got a chance to become something completely new."

_I do not want to *be* something completely new._

<br />

<br />
<br />

The hut's walls rattled in the wind. After two months living in the tengu village, Denri could almost tune it out. 

She sat on her straw bed with legs crossed and body hunched over a flat chunk of stone. A single torch filled the small space with flickering light. Her bundle of colored chalks lay unfurled on the bed beside her. She held a stick of white in her hands as she made a series of delicate marks against the stone, her face set in a mask of concentration.

The once empty room was now filled with decorated stones. Some were covered with pleasing patterns of color. Others depicted stick figure scenes of dubious artistic quality. Nearly all were vulgar in some way.

Shiri's head perked up from the bed and he looked towards the door. Denri paused from her drawing and looked to Onara, who lay across the room on a throne of dirty clothes. She was looking at the door as well.

A few minutes later, there was a knock and a whisper at the door. Denri called Aki inside.

"That had to be at least 5 minutes. I think that's the furthest they've ever sensed you."

Aki eased the door shut and turned into the room. She beamed. "I've been practicing! I told them I was coming when I left my room. I wasn't sure if the range was still too far for me though. Neither one of these two is good about responding." Aki stuck her tongue out at Onara, then flopped onto the bed next to Denri and pulled Shiri into her lap. She kicked her feet against the edge of the bed with the sort of frenetic energy that only a small child with a secret can muster.

It gave Denri a momentary sense of vertigo. She had to remind herself that Aki was in fact a very young child. 

Ever since she awakened Hattori, Aki's body had been growing noticeably. The girl was now taller than Denri, with a body approaching that of a teenager. The large vertical slash that stood where her right eye had been only served to make her look older.

"What's got you so excited?"

"I learned a new trick!"

"Yeah? What is it?"

Aki wiggled and squirmed on the bed, jostling Shiri to and fro. The cat looked at her sideways, indignation writ over his face. "I don't wanna tell you I wanna show you!"

"All right, all right. Can you contain yourself for a few minutes while I finish this drawing? Or are you gonna keep bouncing my cat until he pukes on my bed?" Aki bobbed her head up and down in a decidedly unrestrained way. But she did her best to hold still. Somehow that only raised the frenetic tension in the room.

After a few minutes, Denri felt Aki's chin rest on her shoulder. "What're you drawing?"

Denri shooed her away. "I can't finish with you flopping all over me! Artists need space, you know."

Denri made a few dramatic flicks of her wrist as she put the finishing touches to her work. Then she lifted the stone and turned it towards Aki with a healthy dose of pride. The dark stone depicted a tall lanky stick figure with scraggly hair that looked passingly like Eizo. He stood beneath a tree, a stern frown on his face. Hattori sat in the branches above him. A white glob was in freefall from Hattori's butt to Eizo's head.

Aki giggled. "Are you two getting along better?"

Denri hefted the stone and placed it along the wall with the rest of her masterpieces. "Define better. I hit him in the face a couple times today. That's better than usual."

"Denri!"

"You asked!"

Aki shook her head. "You should be nicer to him."

"Hey, I talk to him and train with him and I'm not arguing to kill him anymore, right? He'll get nice Denri when he proves he deserves her. I thought you wanted to show me a new trick or something. Let's get back to that part."

Aki made a huff a moment longer, but Denri held firm. Aki was excited about this new trick of hers. Denri knew she'd break first.

"Alright, alright!" A grin broke out across Aki's face. She leaned in towards Denri and lowered her voice to a whisper. "Do you wanna pull a prank with me?"

Denri looked at Aki seriously, her face dark. "Aki. You came here to pull a prank?"

Aki sat back, caught off guard by Denri's response. "We don't have to! I just thought I could show you my new--."

"And you let us waste all this time drawing on rocks and talking about Hattori? Lead with the fun stuff next time!" Denri clapped her hands and rubbed them together hungrily. "What did you have in mind? Should I bring my chalk?"

<br />

<br />
<br />

The mountaintop was dark at night. Lanterns stood no chance against the wind, so the only light came from behind closed doors and boarded windows. Aki and Denri crouched in the darkness and leaned against the rough stone of the mountain. Eizo's hut sat before them, huddled against the cliff face that marked the highest point of the village. There were only a handful of buildings higher up. Eizo's desertion of Ninigi's Blades and Aki's unexplained powers to awaken tengu had earned them an honored spot.

Denri elbowed Aki. "Does he know you're gone?"

Aki nodded. "I told him I was going to see you."

Denri threw her head back and groaned. "Aki! You have so much to learn. He's totally going to be on alert if he knows you're with me. Next time tell him you have to poop or something." Aki looked towards the ground, her shoulders slumping. "No, no, don't give me any of that 'I'm adorable and you made me sad' crap. It's fine, we'll work something out. Where does he keep the journal?"

"It's always beside his bed at the back of the room."

"Alright, then I'll climb up on the rock so I can slip in one of the side windows. Can you keep him focused on the front of the hut until I grab the notebook?" Aki nodded. "Great. I'll grab the book while he's not looking, we run like mad, then we work some artistic magic all over the front cover. Easy. Wait until I get into position."

Denri peeled off from Aki, her night vision letting her pick her way across the surface of loose rocks without making a sound. When she got near the house, Denri took a few quick steps and launched herself toward the cliff wall. She caught a handhold and swung herself further up. There was a window set into the hut's wall where it met the cliff face and was shielded from the wind. Denri scrambled up to it and turned to give Aki a thumbs up. Now to see whatever new trick Aki had cooked up.

Aki returned the thumbs up, then placed her hands along the ground. She seemed to strain for a moment. Then her skin darkened and rippled. Her body shrank and a tail sprouted from her back. Denri blinked and Aki was replaced by a perfect replica of Onara.

Denri almost whistled in appreciation, then remembered where she was. She looked through the window as cat-Aki stalked towards the front door. Eizo was sitting in his underwear at a small desk, diligently repairing a hole in his pants. Denri felt only a flash of jealousy that Eizo and Aki got furniture in their house. She reserved the rest of her mental faculties to memorize Eizo's current appearance. She was going to need an exceptionally nice rock to memorialize the scene.

The door swung open slightly as Aki pressed her feline head against the door. Eizo looked up at the sound.

"Oh no." He stood up and started backing away from the door. Aki meowed and started walking towards him. "What do you want? I don't have any food." Eizo nearly jumped out of his skin as he backed into a low wooden stool. He grabbed his chest. "I thought the other one had snuck in too." Aki meowed again. The girl was relentless. Denri used the moment of distraction to ease the window open. It was hard to work while clamping a hand over her mouth to stop the giggles.

Eizo reached his bed and sat down heavily upon it. He threw his pants at the cat in a final defense. "There! You can sleep on those. They smell like me." Aki stepped over the pants and jumped onto the bed. Denri slid through the window as Aki curled in Eizo's lap. He winced as she kneaded his bare legs with her claws "Denri let you out to torment me, didn't she?" He placed a resigned hand on the cat's back and began to pet it. 

Denri turned her attention to the small table by Eizo's bedside. How much extra furniture did these two need? Honestly. A small leather book laid on top of the table. Eizo sat with his back to it. Denri snuck forward, bare feet moving soundlessly across the floor. She reached the table and probed her arm forward.

Eizo's hand darted backwards, catching Denri's in a grip like iron. She yelped involuntarily in surprise. "May I help you?"

"Oh, you know. Just looking around for Onara. Have you seen her lately?" The cat in Eizo's lap stood and tried to slink away, head and tail drooping. Eizo caught the cat by the scruff of the neck. "Oh look, you found her! Good thing I came looking here first. Ha ha ha."

Eizo held the cat to his face. "I assume this is not Onara then. Aki?" The cat meowed piteously. Eizo gave it a shake. "Aki." The cat grew in Eizo's hand until he was depositing Aki onto the bed next to him.

"How did you know it was me?" She looked at the floor, prepared for a berating.

"You did not scratch me when I reached back for Denri and disturbed you in my lap. What were you two trying to do?" 

Denri tried to catch Aki's eye and signal to stay cool, but Aki spilled the beans immediately. "We were going to steal your notebook and draw funny things all over it." 

Eizo gave Aki a stern look. "I understand something like this from her, but I expected better of you."

"Hey!"

"I'm sorry." Aki looked miserable. "I just wanted to show Denri my new trick."

Eizo moved his hand to Aki's shoulder. He still held Denri like a vice. She considered chewing through her wrist to get free. "It was a very impressive trick. You're getting stronger every day." Eizo turned towards Denri. "You both are."

Aki brightened. "We are! Do you think the sage will let us leave soon then?"

Eizo nodded. "Once she's certain we can take care of ourselves and avoid getting caught."

"Good, because we need to leave as soon as possible!"

Eizo mussed up Aki's hair. "And why is that."

The girl shook her head, fighting off his hand. "Because we don't have much time if we want to win the Tournament!"

Eizo and Denri both looked at Aki askance. "Say that again?"

"We should join the Tournament!"

Eizo looked at Aki sternly. "Aki, we need to stay in hiding. We can't do something public like join the Tournament."

"Sure we can! We could just use made up names so no one knows who we are."

Denri thought for a moment. "You know, it might not actually be that crazy of an idea." Eizo's head whipped around to face her, looking betrayed. "No, really. If we're in the tournament, then in theory no one can mess with us, right? Or at least, the gods and other champions have to offer us a reasonable challenge before they can attack us. And if we win they would have to leave us alone."

"What's your point?"

"You've pissed off a god and at least one champion by deserting. And whatever is going on with Aki, there's got to be people of a similar power level behind it. What I'm saying is that I'd rather deal with those people in a series of well-structured challenges that we have a chance of responding to. As opposed to, you know, just getting snuffed in our sleep."

Aki nodded vigorously. "And if we win, then the gods have to give us a place where no one could bug us. Hattori and the other tengu could come live with us too!"

Eizo scratched his chin. "I don't know. You make a good point that the Tournament rules might give us some cover. But there's so much we don't understand about what's going on with Aki. What if we broadcast ourselves and the people hunting her don't care about the tournament rules? And even if we do win, I'm not sure I want to be in charge of a domain, playing politics with the other champions."

"No argument on that last point." Denri flopped down onto the bed. "No argument on that last point. If our ranking somehow gets high enough for that to be a possibility, we can talk about it then. Otherwise I'd rather not set ourselves some big grand mission. Let's just take it as it goes." Aki took a breath to protest, but Denri held up a hand. "I'm not saying we _can't_ do that. Just that there's a lot of steps between here and there. Let's focus on the world in front of us.

"But to your other point. Even if we don't know what's going on with Aki, we know joining the Tournament would take the heat off you, right? That lets us focus at least. Besides, running across the country and going on adventures sounds like a lot more fun than spending our whole life in hiding."

Eizo didn't look convinced. "I would still rather understand what's going on with Aki's abilities before we make ourselves known."

Aki smiled and jumped forward wrapping her arms around Eizo and Denri in a hug. Denri returned the hug without thinking. "What's this for?"

"Nobody mentions splitting up anymore. We talk like a family."

Denri looked over Aki's shoulder and grinned at Eizo. "Sounds about right to me."

Eizo hesitated for a moment, years of hardwired defense mechanisms warring for control. Then he returned the smile and leaned into the hug. As they hugged, Denri slid her hand towards Eizo's journal. He smacked it away playfully.

<br />

<br />
<br />

A few days later, Denri stood in the training circle with Eizo, focusing on her triple staff. She held the weapon at each end, electricity arcing up and down its length. Sweat dripped down her brow as she maintained the flow.

"Good. Now try to center the charge in the middle rod."

Denri did as Eizo instructed, focusing on the center rod. The move was much harder than just arcing the energy up and down the staff between her hands. It was like going from tossing a ball back and forth to _becoming_ the ball and floating in midair. 

It felt like poking something with a stick. The wood was separate from her body, yet somehow she could still get a sense of the thing being poked. It required a sort of half-focus, giving her body enough space to work instinctively while also directing the motion.

The blue sparks traveling up and down the weapon coalesced into the center. As the sparks left the two end rods, they jerked out of Denri's hands and snapped together with a sharp clank. The staff fell to the ground with a clatter and a flash of discharged sparks. 

"What happened?"

"Interesting. I've heard that electric resonants could move metal with their abilities. I never understood how. But it seems like the rods are attracted to one another when they don't all have the same current."

Denri picked up the staff and tried again, focusing her electricity into various parts of the staff. It was clumsy, but if she focused, she was able to make the staff twitch and snap in different directions. "Coooool."

"Indeed. I have no idea how to incorporate this into any of the fighting styles I know, but it seems like it could be powerful. You'll have to experiment on your own."

Denri smiled, her mind already spinning through possibilities. 

"Your electrical output has increased a lot over the last couple weeks."

"Yeah. Why is that? It's just sort of happening."

"Increasing strength is somewhat natural. Using your power causes you to come into better alignment with the ideal that formed the bond. But usually the progress is not this quick. My guess is that you were already very well aligned, but the stress and fear brought on by being in the wilderness was suppressing it. As you grow more comfortable, you're returning to your earlier state of mind."

Denri looked up at Eizo. "Wait, you're telling me I can lose my power if I get scared? That seems like the _most_ important time to have it!"

Eizo shrugged. "Resonant bonds are sometimes quite fragile. That's why many champions keep their towns ideologically pure. You don't want your soldiers losing their power because someone made a good point over beers. 

"A significant part of our training as Blades was mental exercises to keep a clear head and strong ideals. There are countless stories of promising new recruits panicking in their first battle and being left defenseless."

Denri made a face. "Does that mean I'll have to become like you to keep my power?" She let her face fall slack and expressionless, moving her arms stiffly. She dropped her voice to imitate Eizo's. "I am a serious warrior. I do not like cats."

"It depends on the resonance. Knowing you, I would guess your ideal is something more wild and chaotic." He smirked and rose an eyebrow at her expectantly.

Denri looked at Eizo, momentarily stunned. "Wait. Are you trying to-- was that supposed to be a comeback? Oh buddy, we need to work on your banter."

Eizo frowned, looking self conscious. But before he could respond, there was a flutter of wings. The two of them looked up in time to see Hattori as he descended from the sky, flapping hard against the wind. He landed heavily near them, the white feathers of his wings folding flat along his arms. His body seemed tense.

Eizo took a step towards the tengu. "What's wrong?"

"Jakucho has requested your presence immediately. One of our scouts saw a raiding party approaching through the woods. They looked like Blades."

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

Denri and Eizo sat around the fire pit in Jakucho's hut. The old sage sat at the head of the room, her staff crossed over her lap and her face stern. Hattori sat along with a few of the more senior daitengu. Denri got the feeling she and Hattori were only present because they had been in the area when Jakucho called her advisors.

A crow tengu knelt by the fire near the door, delivering its report in a series of grunts and caws. Jakucho translated for Denri and Eizo's benefit.

"He says a group of five knights are approaching from the north, they seemed to be moving purposefully in our direction."

Eizo sat formally, his hands clenched on his knees. "What were their colors?"

A brief interchange between Jakucho and the scout. "Red and orange. Their shields had the image of a sword thrust into the ground."

"Sadashi." Eizo spoke quietly to himself. He lifted his head and addressed the rest of the group. "I would assume that if your scout saw them, they knew of the scout's presence as well."

Jakucho nodded. "I believe they are here for us. If not, they would have tried to make contact with the scout and request aid on whatever their mission is. They would have no reason to believe we weren't loyal to Ninigi and his champions if they didn't know who we are." Many around the circle nodded in agreement, Eizo included. "I would like to hear this group's opinion on what to do before I make my decision."

One to the daitengu bowed his head. "Elder, we should gather our hunters and strike them when they break cover from the trees and start up the mountain. The terrain will be in our favor and we won't have to worry about defending the rest of the villagers." A few of the other daitengu mumbled in agreement.

Jakucho held up a hand for silence. "We have ignored Ninigi's orders, but we have no desire to fight him. If we attack his followers, he may decide that we are his enemies, not just deserters. I do not want to give him any more reason to hunt us. Eizo, you know the Blades better than any of us, what is your opinion?"

"If Sadashi has sent a party of Blades this way, it's safe to say that they're serious about finding your village. Ninigi views disobedience more or less the same as a direct assault."

"What do you think about attacking then?"

Eizo kept his eyes toward ground. "I would not know. Your people know the land and your own capabilities far greater than me. I shouldn't make such a decision on your behalf."

Jakucho gave him a stern look. "I am not looking for you to make the decision. Only to give your opinion."

"I--." Eizo paused, looking uncomfortable. He clutched his hands nervously.

Denri raised her hand, trying to draw the conversation off of Eizo. For some reason, he didn't seem to want to talk. "Wouldn't attacking be stupid?" The daitengu who had spoken earlier turned angrily towards Denri. She shrugged. "I'm not trying to be rude, but Jakucho said herself if Eizo still had his powers, the hunting party that captured us wouldn't have stood a chance. Now there are _five_ of them. Seems like bad odds to me."

Jakucho nodded in agreement. "Attacking would almost certainly be pointless."

"Then what are we to do? If they were able to find us this easily, they must be able to sense our presence. They'll keep hunting us if we flee. And we can't just keep moving the entire village indefinitely."

"That's not necessarily true. You all could sense Eizo as we were approaching through the woods, but you clearly missed some of the details. They might be using something similar. Do you have some sort of range? Maybe we can run if we get outside that."

Jakucho shook her head. "We would already be out of range if they were using the same ability. That's why we roosted so deep in the wilderness. This must be something different."

Denri turned to Eizo. "Well, is there some secret Blade power that lets them track us forever?"

Eizo thought for a moment. "No, I can't think of any techniques we learned that would allow that. But it may not be an ability. Most of the Blade's equipment is supplied by the Twins. Who knows what kind of machines those two have concocted in the years since I left. They may have something that amplifies a Blade's ability to sense the tengu."

Denri sat back, pointing at Eizo in triumph. "There you go. We don't need to attack. If we take whatever device they have and run, we'll leave them blind."

Jakucho looked at Denri thoughtfully. "How do you propose we steal this device if it allows them to sense us as we approach?"

"That's simple. _You_ don't. I do."

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

Eizo and Denri stood at the edge of the village as the tengu hunting party prepared. The plan was to have a small group attack the Blades at the front to distract them as Denri snuck in the back. 

"Any other big abilities I should know to look out for?"

"Their power focuses through their blades and can cut nearly anything. Do not try to block their blows, you have to dodge. And they will heal quickly, so do not count one out just because they have fallen to the ground."

"Oh, great. Unkillable killing machines. No big deal. Remind me again why you wanted to quit these folks?"

Eizo ignored the frenetic humor and grabbed Denri by the shoulders. "Are you sure you want to do this? I thought you hated the monsters living in the wilderness. Why risk your life now?"

Denri shrugged, trying to look calm. "I'm not some bleeding heart for all monster kind everywhere now. But these people are trying to be better. Some of them have a lot to atone for, and I don't like all of them, but they're trying."

"That's very honorable of you."

"Yeah, well, that's me. Brave hero standing for her ideals like a big old idiot right here." There was a companionable silence as the two stood waiting for the tengu to finish their preparations.

Denri looked at Eizo sideways. "By the way, what was the deal with you back in that meeting? The whole time I've known you, you're decisive military man through and through. But back there you turned green the moment Jakucho asked your opinion."

Eizo looked away. "It was nothing."

Denri elbowed the man. His ribs weren't quite so bony anymore. "Hey, none of that. Remember what Aki said. Family now."

Eizo continued staring across the tengu as they prepared for a moment. He returned his attention to Denri with a sigh. "I thought I could be a better person if I gave up a life of killing and violence. But then just as you said, I spared Hattori during that fight and he nearly killed Aki. I've been wrong so many times. I just don't want to make decisions with people's lives anymore."

Denri wanted to tell Eizo that was stupid. You don't get to avoid morality just because it's hard. But Eizo's face looked so sad and uncertain. And she didn't want to punish him for opening up. "Well you're in luck. Aki and I are pretty much the best, so you can leave the decision making to us for a while and not feel too bad."

Eizo smiled. "That's the plan."

"Great, just one more reason not to die. No pressure or anything."

As the two stood together, Hattori broke off from the other tengu and approached. "Ugh, remind me again why I have to take him along."

"The Blades can sense other creatures with a bond to Ninigi. But since Aki awakened him, Hattori's bond has shifted to her. And your chances of success are much higher with--."

Denri was looking at Eizo with an arched eyebrow and a wry smile.

"Oh. You were just bantering."

"Yup."

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

Denri did her best to remain quiet as they moved through the trees. It wasn't easy, considering how Hattori's talons pinched her shoulders every time he flapped his wings. He brought them down to the ground a few hundred feet from the Blades' camp and Denri rubbed her shoulders gratefully.

"That has got to be the _worst_ way to get around." She kept her voice low.

_My talons were not originally meant to carry willing creatures..._

"That's a happy thought."

They made their way through the darkness towards the pinpoint of light that was the Blades' campfire. If she hadn't already known the Blades were dangerous, the fact that they were unconcerned about drawing the attention of monsters would have been a sure sign. They paused a hundred feet out and waited for the hunting party to make their move.

A few minutes passed. Denri could see shadows walking across the campfire. Big with lots of sharp edges. There was a loud crash at the far side of the camp and the shadows turned. They ran to the other side of the campfire and resolved into gleaming suits of armor before disappearing into the woods.

"Alright, that's our cue." Denri stood and started walking towards the camp. Hattori moved beside her clumsily, his eyes straining ahead of them. "Hey, stay focused." Her voice was barely a whisper.

_I should be fighting with my brothers and sisters._ An elbow from Denri brought his attention back to the ground in front of him.

They reached the edge of the camp and took a moment to make sure there weren't any stragglers. A felled tree lay near the edge of the clearing, its branches torn free to feed the fire. A few rounds had been cut from the trunk to make seats around the fire. A large tent stood on the opposite side of the fallen tree. The sounds of combat rang through the woods on the other side of camp, but the clearing was quiet.

"You keep watch outside while I check in the tent. And take a look through their gear in case it's there."

_Why do I have to be on watch? I'm already away from the fight. I want to do something._

"Well, seeing as how you can give me a heads up _in my mind_ without alerting anyone, you can just deal with it. Unless of course you actually can read my thoughts."

_Fine. I will keep watch outside._

"That's what I thought."

Denri swung around the clearing until she was near the tent, then slipped from the trees and padded towards her target. She reached the back of the tent and dropped to her stomach, lifting the canvas and peering inside. The tent was empty.

A twig snapped to Denri's left and her head shot up, body filling with adrenaline. Hattori stood at the edge of the trees, frozen as he looked around. It seemed no one had heard his misstep. Denri rolled her eyes and then slid under the canvas and into the tent.

Denri rifled through the Blades' belongings, starting with the packs that were stacked against the tent wall. The tengu hunters were on the lookout for a sensing device as well, but Denri didn't think the Blades would risk bringing the sensing device into a fight. They wouldn't need it up close anyways.

Denri made it through the packs without finding anything out of the ordinary. She started tossing the bedrolls left and right, still with no success. Denri started to worry that the Blades had carried the device with them.

There was a loud thud outside the tent, followed by a scramble of feet and a flurry of wings. _Help!_

Denri pulled her folded triple staff from her waist and ripped open the front flap of the tent. Hattori was lying on the ground, backing hastily away from a mountain impersonating a man. A mountain wrapped in metal and moving with the quiet ease of a cat. He looked up at the sound of the tent flap and Denri felt 20 pounds heavier. Even his gaze was physically imposing. The sword hanging at his side glowed a faint silver.

Hattori flipped onto all fours and tried to scramble towards her. _Time to get out of here!_ As he ran, the Blade took a step forward and swung his sword, arcing up from the ground towards Hattori's back.

There wasn't time to think. Denri's body tensed and she shifted forwards, reappearing between Hattori and the onrushing blade. She brought her staff up, holding two of the rods and pulling the chain between them taught to catch the blow. The chain held for a heartbeat. Long enough for Denri to Eizo's voice in her mind, reminding her not to block. She staggered back into Hattori, pulling her head back just as the blade flared with light and cut through the chain like butter. She felt the passing wind against her chin as the blade arced toward the sky.

Denri pushed off Hattori and swung the uncut segment of her staff like a nunchuck. The metal rod sparked with a burst of electricity as it arced toward the man's head. The giant man's sword twisted in the air and snapped across his body, cutting through the other chain easily. The end of Denri's staff flew through the air and landed behind the man. Then he introduced his boot to her chest and sent her careening through the air.

Denri landed in a heap, barely managing to hang on to the two disconnected metal rods that were the remains of her staff. She spit some blood from her mouth. "OK, I'll give you round one." She staggered from her feet and raised her weapons. "But at least it's finally not monsters."

She ran forward but came up short as the Blade reached forward and grabbed Hattori from the ground. The tengu kicked fruitlessly, trying to break free. On the man's wrist was a chunky, mechanical bracelet with a small weighted chain anchored at its center. As the giant knight lifted Hattori into a headlock with one arm, the chain snapped taught and pointed at the tengu.

The device must have been sensitive enough to detect Hattori's lingering connection to Ninigi. The Blade's had known they were sneaking around the back the whole time.

"Where is the girl?"

Denri froze. "What?"

The man called to the woods around them. "You try to hide your presence by sending one of your pets closer." We shook Hattori. "I'll just kill it if you don't come out."

The Blade's words clicked into place and Denri cursed. The device wasn't sensing the remnant's of Hattori's connection to Ninigi. It was sensing his connection to Aki. They weren't here for the tengu.

"So be it." The Blade brought his sword up towards Hattori's neck. 

Denri raised both metal rods and filled them electricity. Many things happened at once. The two rods shot apart until the left one ripped out of her hand, pinwheeled through the air, and buried itself an inch deep in a tree trunk. A metal pot that had been resting on the nearby cook fire shot towards her. She pulled her hand down and the pot went careening into the forest. Finally, the man's sword ground to a halt in the air.

The Blade strained against the magnetic pull. Denri staggered forward before she planted her feet, grabbed the rod with both hands, and leaned backwards with all her strength. The blade began inching forwards again as Denri slid, inch by inch, forward.

"Hattori. If you wanted. To. Do. Something. Useful."

Hattori fumbled around the pouch at his waist, his motions clumsy with his arms pinned to his side. He managed to fumble a dagger out of the pouch, then nearly lost it as Denri's magnetic field tried to rip it out of his hands. He clenched his fist and drove the dagger into the Blade's side. There was a sharp intake of breath and the man pulled on his sword with renewed strength.

Denri flared the electrical current as bright as she could, trying to hold the blade at bay. The man's armor groaned in response. There was a loud whirring sound, followed by an earsplitting metallic _thwack_.

The arm holding Hattori went slack. The tengu pried himself free and scrambled away. Sticking out of the Blade's shoulder was the metallic rod that he had cut from Denri's staff earlier. The metal was buried several inches deep. Denri released the electric current with a yelp as the other rod pried itself free from the tree trunk and shot towards her.

"I meant to do that!"

The man growled, stabbing his sword into the ground and reaching up to the rod embedded in his shoulder.

"Seriously? You're just gonna rip that out no problem? What was Eizo _thinking_ leaving you guys?"

Denri raced forward. "Hattori, we need to do something about that tracker on his wrist!"

Hattori drew two daggers from his belt and leapt into the air as he threw them. The man ignored the weapons as they bounced off his armor. He grunted as he pulled the rod free of his shoulder and dropped it to the ground. He drew his sword again.

"Try that again!" Denri slid past the man, putting him between her and Hattori. She pulsed energy into the rod in her hands as Hattori threw another wave of daggers. The weapons accelerated as Denri's field caught them, punching into the man's armor. He snarled in frustration and swung his blade behind him, aiming straight for Denri's neck.

There was a loud whine as the blade cut through the air, moving too fast for Denri to duck out of the way. Well, if she couldn't dodge, at least she could make it hurt like hell. Denri drew another burst of electricity and focused it into her arm.

There was a heavy, mental _click_ as Denri's perspective shifted. The energy took on a different tone as it flowed into her arm. Her muscles flared.

Denri caught the Blade's arm, stopping its progress completely. He looked down at her in surprise, the metal buckling under her fingers. Denri filled the other arm with electricity and punched the man in the side. His armor buckled and he was thrown to the ground several feet away. Pain lanced up Denri's arm as the bones in her forearm cracked.

Denri and Hattori both stared on in amazement for a moment. "Hah! Did you _see_ that? I was all like _pew_, _pew_." Denri punched the air a couple times, then winced at her broken arm. She stumbled as a wave of exhaustion and dizziness hit her.

The Blade on the ground groaned and started to stir. "Are you _serious_?" Denri pointed with her good arm and called up to Hattori. "What are these things?" She staggered forward and stomped on the man's wrist several times, shattering the tracking device. "Hattori, let's get out of here."

_One more thing._ Hattori landed near the fire and pulled out a burning branch. He tossed it into the Blades' tent. Denri gave him an impressed look.

Then they ran away.
