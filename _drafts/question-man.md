Dawn came early on Sky Furnace. Higher even than the summit of Kazora, the active volcano above which the city floated, the day began with the sun below the citizens' feet. Denri came awake as the room brightened, sunlight pushing through the closed curtains. She yawned and stretched, unusually well rested. The sways and groans of zeppelins felt like sleeping on a ship.

Denri threw open the curtains, flooding the room with red-tinted light, a mixture of the rising sun and the roiling pool of lava below them. Aki groaned and pulled the covers over her head, turning towards the wall. Shiri blinked at her feet.

"Come on, sleepy." Aki mumbled something unintelligible. "You're waking later every day. Now that you've got the body of a teenager you're trying to sleep like one too?" The mound of covers gave no response.

Denri rubbed her hands together and grinned. She put a finger over her lips and shushed Shiri as she tiptoed towards Aki, her fingers sparkling with energy. She pounced.

"Aki! They found us! Arghhh--." Denri feigned a pained cry as she landed on the bed, wrestling the bundle of blankets. Aki's body stiffened as she came awake, scrambling to free herself from the blankets. Limbs flailed. "Erggg. They got me!"

"Denri!" The blankets deflated and an identical copy of Shiri squirmed free at the foot of the bed, hissing as it turned around the room wildly.

Denri fell back into the blankets laughing. "Look at you, hair on end! Going to fight them off as a house cat, are you?"

Cat Aki sat, blinking in confusion, then wounded pride. She leapt to the bed. But as she flew through the air, her form grew. By the time she landed at Denri's feet, she had reached the size of a leopard, though she still looked like the house cat. She placed a large-clawed hand on Denri's chest, staring intently.

**No, I would fight them off like this.** Aki sniffed. Then abruptly licked Denri's face with a rough tongue.

"Bleh! Ow! Are you trying to sand my face off?"

Aki's form rippled as she shrank back to her human form. "That's what you get for waking me up early." She stuck out her tongue.

Did she look older? "That's a new trick."

"You're not the only one getting stronger!" Aki giggled and tossed her pillow at Denri. She flashed a grin that was suspiciously familiar. Denri had seen it in the mirror a thousand times. Somehow she knew Aki was going to tickle her before the young girl even pounced. Shiri leapt to the headboard warily as they rolled off the bed in a mess of limbs and blankets, both laughing uncontrollably.

A sharp knock at the door brought them to a halt. Eizo stepped in, already clean and dressed. His hands were clasped behind his back and his back was straight and stern, one eyebrow raised. "Good, you two are awake. Let's go, shall we?"

"Just waiting on the lazy one." Denri rubbed her fist on the top of Aki's head, further mussing her hair. At the edge of her vision, Denri thought she saw the barest ghost of a smile on Eizo's lips.

<br />

<br />
<br />

Denri scratched at the edge of her mask as they stepped out of the great dragon statue marking the entrance to the Dragon's Den. The smell of sulfur filled her nose. On the platform in front of them, the Hub Spring shimmered beneath its dome of water.

Eizo consulted the crude map drawn by one of the Arbiters the day before. "Unfortunately, these shops are spread far across the town. There's a few clustered together near the--," he squinted at the cramped writing on the parchment, "--Anchor, I think? And a couple more along the way. Let's head there."

Denri quickly understood why the Arbiter suggested they be careful navigating the city. Sky Furnace's rigid control of its residents apparently did not extend to designs for the zeppelins. They crossed from platforms no larger than a cart, topped by precariously tall towers, to wide open boulevards with enough buildings to make a city block. Blacksmiths, carpenters, and crafts Denri couldn't even imagine a name for. Even this early, most shops hissed with steam.

They were climbing a shaky ladder connecting two zeppelins docked at an odd angle when Aki stopped and looked down at the platform below her, her face inscrutable behind the mask.

Denri put a hand on her butt and gave a shove. "Hey, quit gawking. This ladder seems like its gonna give at any second. _I_ can shift back to the platform, but I don't want to tell Shiri you fell into the volcano and burnt to a crisp, kid."

"Everyone's excited about something."

Denri looked over her shoulder at the few people moving across the platform. They were moving normally enough. "How can you tell with these masks? It looks like everybody's ignoring each other the same as yesterday."

Aki shrugged. "I just can. Everyone feels tense."

"I guess that last shopkeeper was a bit antsy." They had stopped at a couple shops already without success. The first was a man who sold devices for tracking monster species, but the designs were nothing like what Denri had seen the Blades carrying.

The second was a woman still in the midst of opening her shop, a process which consisted of turning several cranks as the building opened like some sort of mechanical flower. She sold indescribably complex, intricate wilderness survival devices. But nothing to do with monsters or magic. The woman voice had been dead and matter-of-fact, but she was shifting foot to foot, an excited light in the eyes behind her mask.

Eizo's head appeared over the edge of the platform above. "Whatever it is, it's not what we're here for. Stay focused." But his eyes narrowed and he placed a hand on his sword as he scanned the people around them.

They had to double back once when they realized one of the zeppelins on their path had left the evening before, and they had to wait another half hour for a shop to open so they could climb to its roof and take the ladder to the building above. The city became increasingly three dimensional as they neared Anchor. The sun was high in the hazy sky by the time they reached their destination.

From the few locals who deigned to offer directions, they gathered that Anchor formed the stable core of Sky Furnace. Most of the zeppelins in this area hadn't undocked in decades. Many platforms had grown semi-permanent attachments to each other. Any shops that wanted to avoid the frequent shuffling of locations around the rest of Sky Furnace docked around Anchor. As a result, the region was a claustrophobic, chaotic jumble of zeppelins up and down.

A cluster of zeppelins floated at the Anchor's summit, detached from the rest of the buildings. A single massive platform spanned the zeppelins, holding a sprawling castle complex. A thick metal cable stretched from the castle to the summit of Kazora.

Denri and Aki both walked about with their jaws hanging open, staring at the vertical shaft of buildings above them. They were so thick in some places you couldn't even see the sky. Eizo's focus was on the immediate surroundings as he guided them by the elbow toward the next shop on their list.

Their current destination was a squat building on the ground level, its interior cramped and littered with half finished projects. The only thing keeping the area from feeling like a cave was the large skylight, filling the room with light and giving a view of Anchor above. They were alone when they entered.

A loud clatter sounded behind a door at the far side of the room. It sounded like a thousand pieces of metal falling from a height. "Idiot! They're everywhere!"
There was a heavily muffled reply. "I can't understand a word. Take that wrench out of your mouth. How many times have I told you to _set things down_. Stop trying to carry a hundred things at once!"

A pause, followed by a deliberate, feminine voice. "This shop is half mine, no matter how much mother favored you. I will carry _my_ tools how _I_ see fit."

"Well, _your_ ball bearings are everywhere now, and I don't have time to clean them up. You saw the news this morning, the Arbiters will be wanting as many of these as they can buy."

Eizo rang a bell sitting near the entrance and the voice in the other room cut off. There was a scurrying of feet and the far door opened, a lanky man backed through the opening, securing a mask to his face.

"May I help you?" His deadpan welcome, the same as every other resident they had spoken to in Sky Furnace, could not have been further from the querulous tone a moment earlier. Denri thought the sharp distinction between public and private life in Sky Furnace would drive her crazy.

The man held a half finished device in his hands that looked vaguely like some sort of compass.

"I hope so. We've walked quite a distance across Sky Furnace, looking for someone who sells tracking equipment for resonant bonds."

As the man approached their group, the needle on his device jumped for a moment. He frowned and hit the device with the butt of his hand, but the needle stayed in place. He muttered something to himself before he responded. "You may be in the right place, then. I make devices that sense the five elemental resonances. I've spent most of the morning recalibrating my stock in anticipation of increased demand, though, so my selection is small and you may have to wait for me to finish fixing some of the errors." He gestured down at the device in his hands.

"Ah, unfortunately we are looking for something slightly different. We won't trouble you any further." Eizo and Denri turned to leave, but Aki was standing further in the shop, staring through the skylight in awe. She wasn't paying attention to their conversation.

"What's that building up there?"

The shopkeeper followed her gaze. "This must be your first time to Sky Furnace. That's Castle Six, where the Twins live."

"Six?"

The man shrugged. "Officially it's called Embermount, but it's burned down so many times everybody just refers to it by the current number of rebuilds. Even the Twins call it Castle Six."

"It's burned down six times?"

"Well, five times. This is the sixth castle. But more or less. The Twins are always experimenting with dangerous things." There was a hint of pride in his voice. "There hasn't been an accident since they got the Dragon's Roar working properly, though." He pointed to the heavy metal cable dropping from Castle Six to the volcano below. "They rebuilt the whole thing out of metal after than one. Makes sense when you've got a dragon breathing fire through a pipe directly into the building."

Aki looked down at the man. "They make Tetsujin breathe fire into that pipe?"

"Mhm. He provides most of the energy for the Twins experiments."

"They use him like a forge?"

Denri knew what the hard eyes behind Aki's mask meant all too well. "Very interesting! Well, like my friend said, we'll leave you to your work now." Denri hurried towards Aki, placing a hand on her waist and wheeling her towards the door before she could continue.

As Denri passed in front of the man, the compass device in his hand gave a shrill series of clicks and the needle on its face shot all the way to the right. Denri ducked as a gear shot out the back of the device.

"My apologies." The man's face reddened around the eyes of his mask as he rushed to pick up the flying part, but he kept his voice calm and dispassionate. "This machine requires further recalibration. I should return to my work now before I injure a customer." He paused, looking from the device, its dial still maxed out, back to Denri. "I am sorry that I could not be more help. I hope you have not been searching for too long. How long did you say you had been in Sky Furnace?"

"Just a while." Eizo placed a hand on the girls' shoulders and shooed them through the door quickly. "Sorry again to be a bother." As the door closed, Denri saw the man walking back to his workshop, muttering as he shook the device in his hand.

Once the shop was out of sight, Denri turned to Eizo. "That was weird. Why did he ask how long we had been here? Do you he knows about us? Could he be working for Sadashi?"

Eizo shook his head. "I do not think so. I didn't see any technology used by the Blades in that shop. More likely, he was caught off guard to see someone maxing out the power sensors on one of his trackers. Let us hope he thinks it was simply a malfunction. Still, we should be careful. Another incident like that could draw unwanted attention."

There was a pause as Denri processed his words. "You're saying I maxed out his power sensors?" A smile spread across her face.

"Yes, but that's hardly the most--."

"You hear that Aki? _Maxed out_."

Aki made a show of ooh's and ahh's as Eizo shook his head and they started to climb the platforms to the next shop.

<br />

<br />
<br />

They emerged into the next shop, The Scale and Talon, through a hatch in the floor. Sweat was beading at Denri's lower back as she stepped off the ladder that climbed through the unbearably hot innards of the zeppelin. She looked around as the other two pulled themselves up and closed the hatch. A double door stood open at the far side of the room, showing a wide, cobbled street lined with shops and a good number of Arbiters on patrol.

The Scale and Talon was immediately different from the other shops they had entered. Whereas the others had seemed as much a workshop and scrapyard as they did a store, this room was immaculate. Golden dragon filigrees swirled around the ceiling. Mechanical devices stood atop ornate columns, resting on delicate silk pillows in tasteful colors. A short, portly man wearing lavish white robes slashed with gold beneath his mask was moving between the handful of customers.

The three of them exchanged a glance, then separated to explore.

Denri spent several minutes wandering between the columns blithely. She saw swords, arrows, and a length chain with delicate links and angry barbs. She also saw talons, scales, and vials of blood. But she was unaware of the purpose for the more complex devices. Except for one.

Sitting atop a deep green cushion was a metal dial with a small length of chain hanging from it's center. A band of leather, the same emerald color as the cushion and gleaming in the light, emerged from the back of the device, perfect for strapping around a wrist. It looked a twin to the device Denri had seen on the wrist of the Blade.

Heart beating fast, Denri walked to the pedestal, peering closely to confirm her suspicion. As casually as she could, Denri waved for Aki's attention and motioned her over.

"What? Did you find something?"

Denri lifted the device from its cushion delicately, watching the chain at its center.

Aki looked at the monster parts and vials of blood uneasily as she approached. She lowered her voice so only Denri could hear. "I don't like this place. I want to leave." The chain remained pointing resolutely downward. Now that the device was in her hands, Denri realized it hung with more than just the weight of gravity. The chain pulled actively towards the floor.

"Excuse me, please be careful with that." The well-dressed man was approaching quickly from the other side of the room. His voice remained quiet, but the tension in his shoulders suggested it was a struggle. "Those are very expensive and difficult to have repaired."

"Thank you." He snatched the device from Denri's hand, only slightly faster than what was polite. "Now, may I help you?"

Denri was glad the mask hid her face as her nose wrinkled at the man's heavy perfumes. "What's so special about that thing?"

The man held the device proudly in his hands. "You have a good eye, young lady, even if you don't realize it. This is a wayfinder."

"Like a compass? Or a tracker?"

"This is no ordinary tracker. It has incredible range. It can point out your quarry up to 50 miles away. But it doesn't stop there." He flipped the wayfinder on its side to display a small gear embedded in its side, hands moving with the practiced grace of showman. "Sometimes pointing to the horizon is not so useful. Turning this dial increases the sensitivity so that the wayfinder can detect even _traces_ of your target. Allowing you to follow its trail exactly."

"Amazing. Can it track anything you want?"

The man nodded. "Yes, if you have a sample of what you want to track, and the coin to pay for its recasting. If you have enough gold, you can even have it adjusted to track a specific creature."

There was no doubt, this was what the Blades were using to track Aki. "What's this one pointing to?"

The man chuckled humorlessly, as though Denri had told a bad joke. After a pause he realized her question was serious. "Why, dragons of course." He gestured around the room as though in explanation.

"How hard is it for you to recast it?"

"Forgive me, I believe there's been a misunderstanding. I did not make this device. I commissioned it's production from Shinmon. My shop specializes in hunting dragons and the creation of technologies from their byproducts."

It was all Denri could do not to ball her fists and grind her teeth. Still more searching. "Where does Shin--?"

"Everything here is for killing dragons?" Aki's voice was tight as she looked around the room.

"Well no, not everything. Some of my clients pay for their equipment by sharing some of their spoils, which I sell to those interested in researching and harnessing their properties. I even have a few samples from Tetsujin himself, though those are quite expensive."

"What is that made out of?" Aki pointed to the band on the wayfinder with narrowed eyes. Her finger trembled with anger.

Aki was going to make a scene. Denri looked around, searching for Eizo. He was across the room, searching through the pillars there. He hadn't noticed Denri and Aki's conversation with the shopkeeper yet.

"Ah, again the two of you show a fine eye for quality. This is some of the finest emerald dragon hide money can buy. Taken from the belly for extra pliability. Given your interest, I assume that you wish to purchase? It's an expensive piece, but there is always the possibility of a discount if there's more you wish to purchase alongside it?"

Even Denri was angered by the man's callous indifference to the creatures killed by and for his products. She realized her hands actually _had_ balled themselves into fists. Was she really this mad about the fate of monsters?

Denri turned to Aki, suddenly sensing her intent. Denri didn't try to stop her as the young girl's hand whipped forward, grabbing the wayfinder. Aki held the device over her head, raising on her tiptoes. Then she smashed it against the ground.

<br />

<br />
<br />

"WHAT HAVE YOU--." The man quieted himself with visible effort, knuckling a fist against the forehead of his mask. "Why did you do this?" His voice was ragged and pinched and a flush showed around his eyes.

A shocked silence filled the room as the pieces of the wayfinder scattered to a halt across the floor. Every head turned towards them, including Eizo's. A hand went to the hilt of his blade reflexively as he hurried towards them.

"It's awful. People would have used it to kill. This whole _shop_ is awful."

"They are only dragons, girl." The man paused and took a deep breath as his eyes darted to the open double doors. "If you do not like my wares, you did not have to enter my shop. Now, that device was incredibly expensive, you _will_ pay for it."

The situation was only going to get worse when the shopkeeper realized they had no money. Denri's eyes darted back to Eizo as he wove through the labyrinth of goods for sale. She was gauging the distance, wondering how long she had to stall before they could all run, when Eizo pulled up short. He frowned as he pretended to bury his attention in a dagger beside him, eyes darting back in their direction. Many of the other customers did the same.

A steady chorus of marching armor drew Denri's attention towards the double doors at the front of the Scale and Talon. Three gold armored Arbiters ducked through the entryway, making directly for Aki and the shopkeeper.

A square-jawed woman with a broad nose and a scar under her left eye looked out from the dragon helm. "We heard a disturbance from the street. What's going on here?"

The shopkeeper's anger melted away as he nodded deferentially to the Arbiters. "I am confused as well, Protector. These two just destroyed a valuable piece of equipment, seemingly unprovoked."

"People were going to use it to hurt dragons!"

The Arbiter turned towards Aki, with a look of quiet surprise. It was unclear if the look was because someone had yelled in her presence, or that Aki spoke like hurting monsters was a taboo.

"If you do not deny this man's claim, then you will pay for the damages. And I will remind you that public disruptions are illegal. This is not the day to test the patience of the Arbiters."

The shopkeeper cut in, voice tight. "Protector, I do not mean to question your judgment, but this girl has deliberately destroyed my property. Certainly the consequences should be larger than simply paying the cost of the item?"

"Certainly? Do not presume to pass the judgment of the Arbiters." The shopkeeper shrank back under the woman's glare. "We have more important matters to attend than a surly--."

"He should be in trouble! Tetsujin helps the town. You all should be grateful to him, not selling things to kill his family!"

The shopkeeper's eyes widened, and several customers darted nervous glances toward Aki. Even the Arbiter looked completely taken aback, though she recovered quickly. "I would have let this slide, even if you actions would have earned a sterner punishment on any other day. We have been ordered to secure the city, and I would not waste our time punishing a surly child. But to show insolence to an Arbiter is a step too far even for today."

Denri took a protective step in front of Aki, holding her hands up in a placating gesture. "Please, we didn't mean to insult. We're new to Sky Furnace and still getting used to the rules. My friend is only emotional from her admiration for Tetsujin and the Twins."

"Hold your tongue or you will share your friend's punishment." The woman turned to Denri as she spoke, then paused as she seemed to process the pair for the first time. "You say you are new to Sky Furnace?"

Denri looked to the ground, trying to seem as contrite as possible. "Yes ma'am. We entered the town yesterday and it seems we still have much to learn." She let her shoulders hunch, hoping the woman would see her as a child.

When the woman replied, her voice was probing. "Every Arbiter in Sky Furnace was put on alert this morning. An urgent missive came from Terminus, updating Tournament rankings and announcing an unranked Hero has earned a starting bounty of 60,000 gold pieces." Denri's palms began to sweat as she processed what was being said. Many of the customers were staring openly at their group, now. A few nodded, as though they had heard the news before.

The Arbiter pushed on, her voice becoming dangerous as she continued. The two arbiters behind her had hands on their swords and they looked tensed to draw at a moment's notice. "The Hero is a flit woman. A lightning Adept. It seems she defeated five Blades singlehandedly. Soon after, she challenged Kiyoshi of the Whispers, and won." There was an audible gasp from one of the customers. "The woman was last seen leaving by boat from Kiyoshi's domain six days ago. Just in time to arrive in Sky Furnace... yesterday, did you say?"

"I-- that is quite the development." Denri's throat was dry, her heart beating in her ears. She forced herself not to swallow, to keep her hands steady. Aki took a step closer, startled out of her anger. "I can see why you would be suspicious of our arrival. But I promise it's nothing more than a coincidence."

"And not an hour before, we receive word from our fellow Arbiters. A shopkeep in Lower Anchor reports that a flit woman maxed out his resonant scale. Traveling with another young woman and an older man. Where is your other companion?"

A man at the back of the shop screamed. A loud crash shook the floor and glass shattered. Denri looked up to see a man sprawled over a toppled pillar. Ahead of him, a rack of vials had fallen to the floor and shattered, throwing dragon's blood across the floor. There was a hiss as the blood steamed, then ignited. From the corner of her eye, Denri saw Eizo moving along the wall. He moved slowly, but purposefully towards the exit.

Denri didn't hesitate. She sprang forward, placed a palm against the Arbiter's chest, and sent a stunning shock through the armor. The woman's body froze, her head half turned towards the new disturbance. Her jaw clamped shut as her muscles spasmed.

Denri didn't wait to see how the others reacted. She turned and wrapped her arms around Aki. Then she pulled lightning into her legs and ran.

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

Denri ducked into an alley with Aki, her chest heaving as alarm bells began to ring behind them. She nearly knocked Eizo unconscious as he came running around the corner.

"Don't do that!" Denri shook her arm, dissipating the energy she had called into her muscles.

"We don't have much time. We need to make it to the tether and get out of Sky Furnace." Eizo continued past, forcing them to follow as he wove deeper into the mire of shops and buildings.

"But we haven't learned anything about Aki's powers yet. I got a lead talking to that shopkeeper before everything went crazy. Someone named Shinmon."

"It's too late for that now. We'll have to find another way to find out what's going on. It's not worth the risk of staying here. Not with the city on alert like this."

Denri opened her mouth to protest, but closed it rapidly as Eizo pressed them all against a wall. A group of Arbiters ran past in the street ahead.

Aki spoke in a whisper as they waited. "What about Shiri and Onara? They're back at the inn with our things."

"Can you call them?"

Aki shook her head. "Not unless we get closer. And the door is closed, I don't think they could get out."

"We can't go back to the inn. Who knows what Anko has told the Arbiters."

Denri grabbed Eizo's forearm. "We are _not_ leaving them Eizo. We're going back."

Eizo hesitated for a moment and Denri tightened her grip, her knuckles going white. He nodded and they started forward again. They kept to the shadows, darting across streets only when they had to.

"I don't understand. Kiyoshi said she was going to wait as long she could to report Denri's challenge. Was she lying to us?" Aki gasped. "Do you think Hattori is OK?"

Eizo replied in barely a whisper as they crouched behind a low wall, waiting for a group of residents to finish crossing the bridge to the next platform. "I do not think she has betrayed us. You have not sensed trouble through your bond with Hattori."

Denri nodded. "There was that business with the Blades, too. Kiyoshi didn't know about that."

"My guess is that Sadashi reported you, at which point Kiyoshi was forced to report your challenge with her as well."

"But why? It wasn't even true!"

They were silent as they lept from their hiding place, running along the bridge in a low crouch. Eizo waited to reply until they had slid down a ladder and were weaving through a series of back alleys.

"He lied to get your starting bounty higher. He's trying to isolate us."

"I thought we wanted high bounties."

"Not that high!" Eizo nearly hissed. "Shifting crown, Denri! 60,000 gold pieces! You're bounty is closer to the Sanyaku than a warrior sleeps to their sword. We needed time to forge alliances before the leaders saw you as a threat, to learn about Aki so we knew who to position ourselves against. But no one can ignore you now. No one will want to come near us.

"And you heard all the information the Arbiters had on you. That report will be sent to every Champion in Yosai. We can't go anonymously anymore."

Denri had never heard Eizo lose his composure. He sounded desperate, out of ideas. They continued through the city in silence.

<br />

<br />
<br />

The Dragon's Den provided one spark of hope. Denri and Aki hid in an alley on an adjacent platform as Eizo approached the statue. He knocked, body tense as he prepared to run if trouble met him on the other side of the door. But when Anko appeared, hurried him inside, eyes darting left and right as she closed the door behind him.

A few tense moments later, Eizo emerged and came to their hiding spot. "Come, it's safer inside."

"Are you sure?"

"I am." He led them back to the statue where Anko was waiting. She nodded as they entered.

"I figured you all might be coming back. Those cats have been meowing in your room all day. I would have seen to them if I weren't afraid they'd just bolt as soon as I opened the door."

"Thank you." Denri looked to Eizo uncertainly, but Anko clapped a hand against her shoulder. "Eh, none of that! I didn't tell the Arbiters to go blow smoke just so you could be suspicious of me. You're safe here lass." She smiled as she pulled back her sleeve to show a tattoo. A circle with six hatch marks around the perimeter. The same tattoo that Eizo bore.

"You're a--!" Anko clamped a hand over Aki's mouth with lightning speed.

"Careful now, lass. That's not something to go broadcasting. Yes, I was. Not a fighter like this one. I worked as a healer before I-- well, let's say Eizo and I have a fair bit in common. I sensed him straight away, even if his bond is dead more or less.

"If I wanted to turn you lot in, I could have done it before all this fuss about tournament bounties. I tried to come and warn you all in your room this morning, but you'd already left."

"Thank you." Denri spoke more earnestly.

Anko waved her hand. "For a looker like this? I'd sell out my own husband. Not that I have one, thank the Mother's Scales." She winked at Eizo. "Now let's get you all to your room. The Arbiters have locked down the Tether, but you can hide here until things die down a bit. They can't keep the city locked up for long."

They walked down the stairs in silence for a moment before Aki cleared her throat. "Did you really tell the Arbiters to go blow smoke?"

Anko barked a laugh. "No, lass. Even I'm not that crazy. But I did tell them I'd never seen hide nor hair of you. And when I started leering at their captain he finished up his questions nice and quick. Not that I was looking seriously now, dear."

Anko placed a hand on Eizo's back as she laughed, but no one else could muster the amusement.
