# Sage Fists
Moto punched forward, crying out in frustration. Sweat dripped freely down his back and brow, his chest heaved, and his limbs felt like lead. His fist traveled straight towards Iruka's smirking face. 

She was going to do something. He knew it. She always did. Moto pushed aside the dread and focused. Would it be a rock from behind? Perhaps a pull on his feet to throw off his balance?

Iruka raised her hand up and Moto felt a tug against his chest, pulling him off his feet slightly. At the same time, Iruka ducked down, dodging under his fist and continuing to pull him forward with her outstretched hand. Moto pulled against the ground desperately, anchoring against her pull and trying to stay close as she dodged. Iruka's front foot slid along the ground as she dropped into a crouch, her foot sliding behind his. Damn.

Moto pulled against the ground, making his feet as heavy as he could. There was a sharp tug on the back of his ankle and his feet shot out from under him. She continued pulling him forward, a strange sense of vertigo from the random bursts of gravity pulling him in different directions. Iruka's pulls were so _powerful_.

At least he had guessed right about her pulling on his feet.

Moto flipped through the air, upside down. He reached down towards Iruka and began to pull. If he could just graze her with a finger as he passed over her head.

Moto felt a painful _thud_ against his stomach as something collided with him in the air. A rock from behind too? Iruka must have been pulling it the whole time he approached, waiting for a good moment to slam it into him. 

It was too bad the test wasn't guessing how Iruka would beat him. He was two for two.

The rock's momentum pushed Moto up and away, sending him crashing to the ground a a few feet from Iruka. She smiled down at him as he lay on his back, the wind knocked out of him. Again.

"You're too focused. All you do is try to hit me."

Moto threw his arms towards the sky, still laying on his back. "You keep saying that like it makes any kind of sense. Of _course_ all I do is try to hit you. That's what you told me to do."

Iruka shook her head, walking away from Moto and getting into position for another round. She turned to face him again, arms clasped behind her back. "I told you to hit me. That doesn't mean you have to _try_ to hit me."

"Oh yeah, great. Now it all makes sense to me." Moto pushed himself to his feet, smacking the dirt from his legs and back forcefully. "At least you follow your own advice, though."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I ask you to explain something and you don't even _try_ to explain it."

Iruka laughed, caught off guard by the joke. She snorted and slapped her leg. "That was a good one, kid." She turned her nose up, looking serious and crossing her arms. "What, you don't appreciate learning from a wise, enigmatic sensei?" Moto rolled his eyes dramatically. 

It had been three weeks of grueling weekend training sessions. And even though he was tired from normal lessons with the other recruits, it felt like Iruka pushed him even harder on his own. But despite all that, he was surprised how much he enjoyed Iruka's company. Especially with Keta gone on his first contract, Moto found himself looking forward to the lessons.

Moto chided himself. What was he doing? He wasn't here to make friends and banter. He settled into a crouch, frowning as he prepared for another attack.

"Alright, alright. I'll explain myself a bit more as payment for the joke. Your tunnel vision makes you predictable. You never divert from your main goal and you always take the route that's most likely to lead to success. Imagine how much easier it would be to hit me if I always responded by trying to jump away from you and maintain the greatest distance possible. Even if I was incredibly skilled at doing that, eventually you'd find a way to exploit it."

Moto stood straight again, frowning. "That doesn't make sense though. In your example, always jumping away _isn't_ the most likely strategy for success. I agree that using a mixed strategy is better, but you're still just trying to maximize your chances of achieving your goal."

Iruka shook her head. "You're putting an unreasonable amount of faith into your own powers of randomization. You _think_ you're pursuing a mixed strategy, but you're a lot more repetitive than you realize."

It was hard to argue against that point, given how little success he'd had over the last three weeks. But Moto gave it a shot, digging in his heels. "That's not fair. You're just way more experienced and skilled than I am. Sure, everything I do looks repetitive because I don't have many options at my disposal. But that just means I need to practice more strategies."

"Even if you practiced an infinite number of strategies, you're overestimating how much you'd actually be able to choose between those strategies rationally. Even if you were a master, you'd develop patterns. And if I know what you're trying to do with those patterns, I have a huge advantage. So if you can't prevent yourself from developing patterns, you have to mix your goals."

Iruka held out both of her hands. Moto jumped in surprise as the rock that had collided with him earlier went zipping over his shoulder towards Iruka. A few other stones arced through the air towards her as well. She spread her arms wide so the stones missed her body.

But instead of shooting off into the distance, the trajectory of the rocks bent sharply as they passed behind her. Iruka was now surrounded by a whirring orbit of four fist-sized stones. They moved in different arcs, outlining a sphere around her.

"Do you know why you have so much trouble hitting me? Besides the fact that you're slow, predictable, and weak, that is." She smiled at him, a playful look on her face.

Moto watched the stones flying through the air. He couldn't imagine the amount of control and focus such a move would require. He inched a foot forwards. There's no way she could fend off an attack while maintaining that. The move was probably meant for offensive maneuvers. "Why...?" Just keep her talking.

"It's because sometimes I'm legitimately _not_ trying to avoid you. I'm just trying to show off. Or I see something that might provide a general advantage, even if I don't know how it would help in this specific instance."

Moto moved in a slow arc around Iruka, acting as though he was just admiring the complexity of Iruka's move. He let the arc take him closer. "So you're saying you just act randomly?"

Iruka shrugged. "Sort of. Sometimes I tell myself I'm going to avoid you without moving my left foot. When you try to read and respond to my actions, it makes you question. Why am I moving that way? Do I have a plan? You hesitate. You struggle to predict my next move."

Moto was standing at the edge of Iruka's vision, just a few strides away. He dashed forward.

Iruka smiled, as though she'd sprung a trap on him. One of the orbiting stones arced around Iruka's shoulders and launched towards him. Moto sidestepped, avoiding the blow and moving closer. Right into the path of a second stone.

"I would have been more surprised if you'd moved backwards."

Moto cursed. He threw his hand to the side and pulled on the rock, altering it's trajectory enough to graze past his shoulder. He continued forwards, lashing out towards Iruka. She pulled against one of the stones as it arced behind her, staying out of his reach. As expected, her reactions were slower as she focused on keeping the rocks in the air. Moto pressed his advantage.

"Or maybe you should have tried to steal one of my stones."

Moto felt a pull against his right side, but it was too light to have any effect on him. Unless...

Moto dipped his shoulder as a stone came flying past, one of the stones he'd dodged earlier. He glanced over his shoulder to spot the second stone.

Moto grunted as Iruka planted both boots against his chest and drop-kicked him away. He staggered backwards, off balance. Right as the second stone crashed into his feet and sent him sprawling face first into the dirt.

After a moment, Moto raised himself into a sitting position, spitting dirt out of his mouth. Both his ankles felt tender.

Iruka sat cross-legged in the grass a few feet away. "Your instincts are good, kid. Maintaining the stone cloud was a distraction. It was a liability. I wasn't planning three steps ahead or deciding on the optimal strategy. I just gave myself options and tried to put you on unfamiliar ground. 

"When you over-committed to the charge, I realized you were open to counterattack. I trusted in my ability to take advantage of the opportunities that inevitably arise on a dynamic battlefield."

Again, Moto found it hard to argue with her point. His body was thoroughly seasoned by dirt and grass after so many failed attempts. But he still felt like she was conflating her superior skill with his own weakness. "What your saying just sounds reckless to me. Treating the battlefield like a game, taking dubious risks, and pursuing random goals hoping that opportunities will arise. A more focused opponent could take advantage of all the inefficiencies."

Iruka spun several small stones around her hand idly as she spoke. "I get the feeling. But there's three things you aren't weighting properly. You're just too inexperienced."

Moto felt his face flush with anger. "Everyone seemed so certain about how young and inexperienced I am. You have no idea what I went through to make it this far."

Iruka arced the stones around her hand, shooting them towards Moto's face. He cried out in surprise, shielding his face from the tiny barrage. "Oh yeah. Because you're the only kid at an academy that trains kids to become spies and assassins who's had some hardship in their life." She rolled her eyes. "Nobody gets you."

Her face softened a bit. "Look, I'm not trying to insult you. Well, OK. Maybe I'm trying to insult you a little bit just for fun. But besides that. You're a smart kid with a lot of potential. But you're new to this world. It's only natural that there's things you don't understand yet.

"The first thing you have to understand is that our abilities _dramatically_ improve our destructive capabilities. But they don't really improve our mental skills at _using_ those abilities. Being a little inefficient isn't that big of a risk because your opponent won't be much better at exploiting it. But if you're predictable and it lets me get an easy hit on you, that hit can come in like a boulder rolling down a mountain.

"The second thing you need to understand is that you're about to enter a far more chaotic world than you're used to." Iruka held up a hand, preempting Moto's indignant reply. "I'm not saying you haven't been through a lot. But the challenges you encounter on contracts, the politics you navigate here in Iga, these won't be like random bar fights with thugs. The people involved are highly trained, and they're trying to mislead you. They're spending their free time come up with schemes to use you and exploit your weaknesses. And when they find one, they strike to kill immediately.

"As a Dagger, you have to distrust everything at least a little bit. Certainty and predictability are the two most deadly flaws you can have. And as a stone resonant, you're especially weak to them. You need to take more active steps than most to avoid them."

Moto blinked. "What do you mean? Why would a stone resonance be weaker to those things?"

"All the personalities of stone - relentless, persistent, unmovable, careful, unyielding - they all have a tendency to get you stuck in ruts. And the more you use the power the more strongly that mindset manifests within you. I've seen you walking around outside Terran house. You're always using your power. That's good, it helps you practice and gain mastery.

"But I've also seen how you fight over the last few months. At Selection Day you were much more nimble. You tried things. You took risks. At the entrance exam you were a bit more one-track mind. And during the obstacle course, you were so myopic it was clear all you were thinking about was how to preserve the run you'd been practicing."

Moto thought back to the moments Iruka referenced. He didn't feel like his mindset had changed much since then. But what if it had? Would he notice?

"I considered other alternatives during the race. I just decided that my original route was probably the ideal strategy."

"Let's imagine it was. But you still nearly _killed_ yourself just to win a practice event. Why would you take such a huge risk for something so small?"

Moto didn't have a response. When he looked back on it, he couldn't quite explain why he'd taken the practice so seriously. Why did he risk dying? He didn't care about impressing these people. His goals were entirely separate.

Iruka shook her head. "Iga wants to make you the most deadly tool it can. But that goes beyond combat training. The competitions, the prestige, the rankings. It's all designed to increase their control over you, to make you behave more predictably. To increase your certainty. So you'll throw away your life for the mission. 

"I used to be like you, ready to away anything to achieve my dreams. I've seen enough people die pointless deaths now to understand who's really benefitting from your boundless ambition."
