# Sage Fists
Moto punched forward, crying out in frustration. Sweat dripped freely down his back and brow, his chest heaved, and his limbs felt like lead. His fist traveled straight towards Iruka's smirking face. 

She was going to do something. He knew it. She always did. Moto pushed aside the dread and focused. Would it be a rock from behind? Perhaps a pull on his feet to throw off his balance?

Iruka raised her hand up and Moto felt a tug against his chest, pulling him off his feet slightly. At the same time, Iruka ducked down, dodging under his fist and continuing to pull him forward with her outstretched hand. Moto pulled against the ground desperately, anchoring against her pull and trying to stay close as she dodged. Iruka's front foot slid along the ground as she dropped into a crouch, her foot sliding behind his. Damn.

Moto pulled against the ground, making his feet as heavy as he could. There was a sharp tug on the back of his ankle and his feet shot out from under him. She continued pulling him forward, a strange sense of vertigo from the random bursts of gravity pulling him in different directions. Iruka's pulls were so _powerful_.

At least he had guessed right about her pulling on his feet.

Moto flipped through the air, upside down. He reached down towards Iruka and began to pull. If he could just graze her with a finger as he passed over her head.

Moto felt a painful _thud_ against his stomach as something collided with him in the air. A rock from behind too? Iruka must have been pulling it the whole time he approached, waiting for a good moment to slam it into him. 

It was too bad the test wasn't guessing how Iruka would beat him. He was two for two.

The rock's momentum pushed Moto up and away, sending him crashing to the ground a few feet from Iruka. She smiled down at him as he lay on his back, the wind knocked out of him. Again.

"You're too focused. All you do is try to hit me."

Moto threw his arms towards the sky, still laying on his back. "You keep saying that like it makes any kind of sense. Of _course_ all I do is try to hit you. That's what you told me to do."

Iruka shook her head, walking away from Moto and getting into position for another round. She turned to face him again, arms clasped behind her back. "I told you to hit me. That doesn't mean you have to _try_ to hit me."

"Oh yeah, great. Now it all makes sense to me." Moto pushed himself to his feet, smacking the dirt from his legs forcefully. "At least you follow your own advice, though."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I ask you to explain something and you don't even _try_ to explain it."

Iruka laughed, caught off guard by the joke. She snorted and slapped her leg. "That was a good one, kid." She turned her nose up, looking serious and crossing her arms. "What, you don't appreciate learning from a wise, enigmatic sensei?" Moto rolled his eyes dramatically. 

It had been three weeks of grueling weekend training sessions. And even though he was tired from normal lessons with the other recruits, it felt like Iruka pushed him even harder on his own. But despite all that, he was surprised how much he enjoyed Iruka's company. Especially with Keta gone on his first contract, Moto found himself looking forward to the lessons.

Moto chided himself. What was he doing? He wasn't here to make friends and banter. He settled into a crouch, frowning as he prepared for another attack.

"Alright, alright. I'll explain myself a bit more as payment for the joke. Your tunnel vision makes you predictable. You never divert from your main goal and you always take the route that's most likely to lead to success. 

"Imagine how much easier it would be to hit me if I always responded by trying to jump away from you and maintain the greatest distance possible. Even if I was incredibly skilled at doing that, eventually you'd find a way to exploit it."

Moto stood straight again, frowning. "That doesn't make sense though. In your example, always jumping away _isn't_ the most likely strategy for success. I agree that using a mixed strategy is better, but you're still just trying to maximize your chances of achieving your goal."

Iruka shook her head. "You're putting an unreasonable amount of faith into your own powers of randomization. You _think_ you're pursuing a mixed strategy, but you're a lot more repetitive than you realize."

It was hard to argue against that point, given how little success he'd had over the last three weeks. But Moto gave it a shot, digging in his heels. "That's not fair. You're just way more experienced and skilled than I am. Sure, everything I do looks repetitive because I don't have many options at my disposal. But that just means I need to practice more strategies."

"Even if you practiced an infinite number of strategies, you're overestimating how much you'd actually be able to choose between those strategies rationally. Even if you were a master, you'd develop patterns. And if I know what you're trying to do with those patterns, I have a huge advantage. So if you can't prevent yourself from developing patterns, you have to mix your goals."

Iruka held out both of her hands. Moto jumped in surprise as the rock that had collided with him earlier went zipping over his shoulder towards Iruka. A few other stones arced through the air towards her as well. She spread her arms wide so the stones missed her body.

But instead of shooting off into the distance, the trajectory of the rocks bent sharply as they passed behind her. Iruka was now surrounded by a whirring orbit of four fist-sized stones. They moved in different arcs, outlining a sphere around her.

"Do you know why you have so much trouble hitting me? Besides the fact that you're slow, predictable, and weak, that is." She smiled at him, a playful look on her face.

Moto watched the stones flying through the air. He couldn't imagine the amount of control and focus such a move would require. He inched a foot forwards. There's no way she could fend off an attack while maintaining that. The move was probably meant for offensive maneuvers. "Why...?" Just keep her talking.

"It's because sometimes I'm legitimately _not_ trying to avoid you. I'm just trying to show off. Or I see something that might provide a general advantage, even if I don't know how it would help in this specific instance."

Moto moved in a slow arc around Iruka, acting as though he was just admiring the complexity of Iruka's move. He let the arc take him closer. "So you're saying you just act randomly?"

Iruka shrugged. "Sort of. Sometimes I tell myself I'm going to avoid you without moving my left foot. When you try to read and respond to my actions, it makes you question. Why am I moving that way? Do I have a plan? You hesitate. You struggle to predict my next move."

Moto was standing at the edge of Iruka's vision, just a few strides away. He dashed forward.

Iruka smiled, as though she'd sprung a trap on him. One of the orbiting stones arced around Iruka's shoulders and launched towards him. Moto sidestepped, avoiding the blow and moving closer. Right into the path of a second stone.

"I would have been more surprised if you'd moved backwards."

Moto cursed. He threw his hand to the side and pulled on the rock, altering it's trajectory enough to graze past his shoulder. He continued forwards, lashing out towards Iruka. She pulled against one of the stones as it arced behind her, staying out of his reach. As expected, her reactions were slower as she focused on keeping the rocks in the air. Moto pressed his advantage.

"Or maybe you should have tried to steal one of my stones."

Moto felt a pull against his right side, but it was too light to have any effect on him. Unless...

Moto dipped his shoulder as a stone came flying past, one of the stones he'd dodged earlier. He glanced over his shoulder to spot the second stone.

Moto grunted as Iruka planted both boots against his chest and drop-kicked him away. He staggered backwards, off balance. Right as the second stone crashed into his feet and sent him sprawling face first into the dirt.

After a moment, Moto raised himself into a sitting position, spitting dirt out of his mouth. Both his ankles felt tender.

Iruka sat cross-legged in the grass a few feet away. "Your instincts are good, kid. Maintaining the stone cloud was a distraction. It was a liability. I wasn't planning three steps ahead or deciding on the optimal strategy. I just gave myself options and tried to put you on unfamiliar ground. 

"When you over-committed to the charge, I realized you were open to counterattack. I trusted in my ability to take advantage of the opportunities that inevitably arise on a dynamic battlefield."

Again, Moto found it hard to argue with her point. His body was thoroughly seasoned by dirt and grass after so many failed attempts. But he still felt like she was conflating her superior skill with his own weakness. "What you're saying just sounds reckless to me. Treating the battlefield like a game, taking dubious risks, and pursuing random goals hoping that opportunities will arise. A more focused opponent could take advantage of all the inefficiencies."

Iruka spun several small stones around her hand idly as she spoke. "I get the feeling. But there's three things you aren't weighting properly. You're just too inexperienced."

Moto felt his face flush with anger. "Everyone seemed so certain about how young and inexperienced I am. You have no idea what I went through to make it this far."

Iruka arced the stones around her hand, shooting them towards Moto's face. He cried out in surprise, shielding his face from the tiny barrage. "Oh yeah. Because you're the only kid at an academy that trains kids to become spies and assassins who's had some hardship in their life." She rolled her eyes. "Nobody gets you."

Her face softened a bit. "Look, I'm not trying to insult you. Well, OK. Maybe I'm trying to insult you a little bit just for fun. But besides that. You're a smart kid with a lot of potential. But you're new to this world. It's only natural that there's things you don't understand yet.

"The first thing you have to understand is that our abilities _dramatically_ improve our destructive capabilities. But they don't really improve our mental skills at _using_ those abilities. Being a little inefficient isn't that big of a risk because your opponent won't be much better at exploiting it. But if you're predictable and it lets me get an easy hit on you, that hit can come in like a boulder rolling down a mountain.

"The second thing you need to understand is that you're about to enter a far more chaotic world than you're used to." Iruka held up a hand, preempting Moto's indignant reply. "I'm not saying you haven't been through a lot. But the challenges you encounter on contracts, the politics you navigate here in Iga, these won't be like random bar fights with thugs. The people involved are highly trained, and they're trying to mislead you. They're spending their free time come up with schemes to use you and exploit your weaknesses. And when they find one, they strike to kill immediately.

"As a Dagger, you have to distrust everything at least a little bit. Certainty and predictability are the two most deadly flaws you can have. And as a stone resonant, you're especially weak to them. You need to take more active steps than most to avoid them."

Moto blinked. "What do you mean? Why would a stone resonance be weaker to those things?"

"All the personalities of stone - relentless, persistent, unmovable, careful, unyielding - they all have a tendency to get you stuck in ruts. And the more you use the power the more strongly that mindset manifests within you. I've seen you walking around outside Terran house. You're always using your power. That's good, it helps you practice and gain mastery.

"But I've also seen how you fight over the last few months. At Selection Day you were much more nimble. You tried things. You took risks. At the entrance exam you were a bit more one-track mind. And during the obstacle course, you were so myopic it was clear all you were thinking about was how to preserve the run you'd been practicing."

Moto thought back to the moments Iruka referenced. He didn't feel like his mindset had changed much since then. But what if it had? Would he notice?

"I considered other alternatives during the race. I just decided that my original route was probably the ideal strategy."

"Let's imagine it was. But you still nearly _killed_ yourself just to win a practice event. Why would you take such a huge risk for something so small?"

Moto didn't have a response. When he looked back on it, he couldn't quite explain why he'd taken the practice so seriously. Why did he risk dying? He didn't care about impressing these people. His goals were entirely separate.

Iruka shook her head. "Iga wants to make you the perfect tool. But that goes beyond combat training. The competitions, the prestige, the rankings. It's all designed to increase their control over you, to make you behave more predictably. To increase your certainty. So you'll throw away your life for the mission. 

"I used to be like you, ready to throw away anything to achieve my dreams. I've seen enough people die pointless deaths now to understand who's really benefitting from your boundless ambition."

Over the last couple weeks, Moto had shared most of his meals with Seiko, the glimmer woman who worked in the Gearhouse. She no longer manned the railway carts in the evenings, but all of the workers had keys to operate the transportation system. Well, all of the workers except for Seiko at this particular moment.

Moto stepped out of the railcar and tucked the ring of keys into the sash around his waist. He arranged them carefully so that they wouldn't jingle as he moved, then stepped into the nighttime shadows surrounding the tracks. He'd have them back to Seiko before she noticed a thing. She was so absorbed in her work when he left, there's probably a good chance she didn't even realize _he_ was gone.

The moon was high and bright this evening, forcing Moto to dart from rock to rock to stay in the shadows. Thankfully, it was late enough that anyone following the rules was asleep. Moto only had to slip past a couple guards and he'd have the Contract House all to himself. 

The terrain on this spire was rocky and desolate. The wind groaned as it blew through the narrow pathways carved between jagged upthrusts of stone. Looming overhead, the jonin training grounds shot up violently, forming a narrow, vertical peak. They cast a shadow over the rest of the spire below. 

Looking up at the stone monolith, Moto couldn't help but feel a looming dread. The cold, lifeless silver light of the moon only served to heighten the affect. This was where Soundstealer spent his days. This was the level he needed to reach. In this moment, it felt so far away.

Moto returned his gaze to the ground in front of him, taking a deep breath and continuing forward. Stay focused.

The thought made Moto hesitate, as it had ever since his conversation with Iruka a few days ago. His focus was what had kept him alive the last three years. It gave him the strength to shoulder the pain that would have buried him otherwise. It had always been his greatest advantage. But was it turning against him?

Moto struck a fist against the stone beside him. His jaw clenched. No. He wouldn't question his resolve. He couldn't.

He pulled himself up a stone ledge and saw the Contract House. It was a large building, though it looked modest with the jonin spire looming behind it. Three stories tall, which a steep shingled roof that flared ornately at the bottom. The crests of the four houses were emblazoned along the front wall, lit from below by small bonfires. The ground in front of the building was clear, with a well-kept stone pathway stretching from the front entrance.

Compared to the austerity of the rest of the spire, the Contract House gave an air of regal superiority. This was where outsiders came to give the Daggers contracts, so it was a flexing muscle as much as it was a functional bureaucratic building. Outsiders would reach this courtyard, shivering and out of breath from climbing through the spartan trails leading from the railway cart, only to stop in wonder at the view before them.

Moto slinked around to the side of the building, giving a wide birth to the warm pools of lantern light bobbing around the grounds in regular intervals. It wasn't hard to avoid the guards when you could climb sheer vertical walls and swing from one place to the next without making noisy footsteps. But then again, the guards were probably placed to stop foreign spies, not members of the village.

Still, Moto was pleased to finally feel like his new powers were granting him an advantage.

A narrow, shingled ledge wrapped around the top of the first and second floors, delineating them from the outside. Moto pulled himself onto the lower of the two and found a window hidden in shadow.

Moto dropped into the hallway quietly, shutting the window behind him carefully. The building was dark. 

Unfortunately, Moto hadn't been able to learn much about the Contract House's layout beforehand. But he knew the building served several functions. It was the entrance to the jonin training grounds. It was where outsiders came to negotiate contracts and deliver payment on their completion. Squads came to look through new contracts. Daggers brought completed contracts back to the building to collect payment. And finally, there was an archive kept of all previous contracts. That was his goal.

The jonin entrance, new contracts, and payment areas were probably on the first floor for ease of access. That seemed obvious enough. After some thought, Moto had decided that the third floor was probably for contract negotiation. Not every client who came to Iga would be obsessed with secrecy. Not inside Iga itself at least, where the only prying eyes were the people being hired. But some of the more careful clients would want a way to avoid any unnecessary exposure. That meant the contract negotiations would be as far away from normal operations as possible. Probably with a secret back entrance to be used for particularly paranoid clients who wanted to feel like extra precaution was being taken.

So Moto moved through the halls of the second floor.

He placed his feet carefully, knowing that the hallway was probably filled with nightingales - floorboards built intentionally to chirp loudly. Just to be safe, he froze whenever the warm glow of a patrol lantern passed by the window. Moto may have been new to obstacle courses and gravity training exercises, but he was not new to thieving.

The first room Moto tried seemed to be some sort of supply storage. It was filled with boxes of blank paper, ink bottles, and some sort of clear liquid that he thought might be used to preserve completed contracts. Such a large store of materials was probably worth a good deal of gold. Useless.

The next room was far more exciting, though still not Moto's original goal. The room was filled with racks of weapons. There were wooden fixtures holding staves and short katana. One wall was taken up completely by daggers, throwing knives, and shuriken. There was a large table filled with short, multi-bladed weapons connected at the handles by chains. All of the weapons had metal inlays. Many were affixed with small gems as well. Jonin weapons, infused by the glimmer weapon smiths. 

Moto closed this door more reluctantly.

The next door opened onto a large, echoing room. Row upon row of wooden shelves, filled with boxes carefully labelled. The archives. 

Moto couldn't read the labels on the boxes in the dark, so he slid the door shut behind him and struck a match. He cupped his hands around the flame carefully to keep the light from shining too visibly. He slid the spent matches into his belt alongside the keys.

It took a while, but eventually Moto figured out the organization scheme of the records. The archive was arranged primarily by the house of whichever Dagger led the mission. Each of the four major sections stretched towards the back of the room, the contracts getting older as they went. But the contracts weren't strictly chronological. There seemed to be some attempt to group contracts by their leader, which left Moto moving back and forth down the Zephys archives looking for Soundstealer.

Moto started running low on matches, so he lit a lantern. It had been nearly 30 minutes and no one had walked by the archives, so Moto figured he could risk the light. He kept its flame low, just in case.

Moto found what he was looking for roughly 15 years back in the archives. He lifted the box from the shelf carefully, wiping away a thick layer of dust. He pulled out a stack of contracts and thumbed through them.

The pages had been coated in a clear resin to keep them from decaying. On each, beneath the list of terms and description of payment, was a long slash of red. Usually, the blood came from the target of an assassination, or a guard felled during an infiltration. Sometimes, it was smeared with the blood of a member from the squad. But every Dagger contract was completed with blood. It's why many people living in Iga called the Contract House the Bloodhall.

Moto rifled through the stacks quickly, checking the dates before pulling out another set of papers. About halfway through, a name caught his eye. One of the Daggers who completed the mission. Iruka Stonesong. Her name appeared more and more frequently, until she seemed to be a regular member of Soundstealer's squad.

Moto reached for the next bundle of papers and his hand hit the bottom. There were only a couple pages left. Strange. The contracts in his hands were still six years away from the present day.

He pulled the pages out and flipped to the end, where he found a page that wasn't marked with blood. The page was untreated and seemed to have been thrown in carelessly. The letters written in the distracted hand of some administrative clerk.

_Further records held in private by request of Soundstealer. Approved by Hisoka._

A stamp marked the bottom of the page. 

Moto stared at the page with growing frustration. He resisted the urge to ball the paper up and throw it across the room. Six years of missing records. Why? Why did Soundstealer start holding his own records?

Moto's thoughts were interrupted by a sharp chirp coming from the hallway outside the archive. The nightingales.

Moto cursed softly and began stuffing the contracts back into the box, doing his best to return them in the order he'd found them. He extinguished his lantern and crept to the door. He could hear voices coming from further down the hallway.

"Sorry dad, I just stepped on a singer."

The reply seemed to come from further away. Moto couldn't make out the words, but the voice sounded male.

"I am hurrying! I just thought I saw some light coming from the archives." Moto recognized the voice. Fumi. Did she say dad? Moto swallowed hard. Soundstealer was here. "Just give me a minute to pick some weapons. I'll meet you outside."

That meant Fumi would stop at the second doorway. Moto nearly sighed out loud with relief.

The footsteps kept getting closer. 

Moto scrambled back from the doorway, retreating down one of the archive's long aisles and hiding himself in the shadows.

The door slid open and silver moonlight pooled in the entrance. Fumi poked her head in, lit from behind. "Hello?" She took a step in and peered around. She reached to the hook by the doorway that held the lantern. And found it missing. She turned back into the room, her body tense.

Moto looked down at the lantern in his hands. Could he leave it on the ground and try to sneak around Fumi? Maybe she would think some clerk had forgotten to put it back when they finished. But the lantern was still warm. Even if he did escape, Fumi would know someone had been in the room recently.

If Fumi thought an outsider had infiltrated Iga, she would tell the masters. Creating an unnecessary security lockdown would be a far more serious transgression than sneaking into the Contract House after hours. But only if they found out he was responsible for it. Was it worth the risk?

Moto set the lantern down as Fumi walked down one of the rows. 

He waited until she rounded the corner, then turned to slip away. There was a loud clank as his foot caught the lantern on the ground.

Moto was knocked to the ground as Fumi shot a blast of wind down the hallway. Moto landed on the ground heavily, groaning as Fumi came racing forward, drawing a dagger from her belt.

Moto held his hands up. "Wait, wait! It's me."

Fumi hesitated. "Moto?"
