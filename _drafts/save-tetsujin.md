Eizo was right about the chaos. Crews were running around barking orders so loud it was hard for Denri to hear her own thoughts. If the docks hadn't been mostly full of flits, she probably would have been trampled. It was wonderful.

Captain Hama had docked midway down the right side of Kazora's crescent-bay port, forcing them to walk a ways towards the center tether that lead to Sky Furnace. Denri was out ahead, swaggering forward with the unsteady, bow-legged gait of a long time sailor back on land. She grinned, berating the younger ship hands darting across decks and into holds. Just like her mom always used to.

It was an act, but a fun one at that.

Aki and Eizo plodded along behind her. Eizo scanning the crowd with his hand on his sword. Aki staring at Denri with wide eyes and mouth agape.

Denri haggled a set of masks from a kid sitting on a crate near a battered hot-iron covered in a patchwork of repairs. Aki was disappointed the only option was a stylized dragon with a blank expression. But at least there was some selection of colors.

The only way off the docks and up to the city was a large cable at the back of port. A glass sphere the size of several carts lumbered up and down the tether. They were shoved unceremoniously into the transport when it was their turn.

Denri squirmed through the crowd of passengers and pressed her face against the glass for one last look below. She smiled at the frenetic energy of the sailors crawling across their ships.

The voyage had been short, but Denri made a resolution to herself. Somehow, before this was all over, she was going to get a boat.

As she was fantasizing about a life at sea, a flurry of activity caught her eye. On the the far left side of the crescent bay, a ship was being unloaded with panicked intensity. The crew was tugging at a number of large crates, stumbling over one another in their haste.

They were dragging three crates bigger than a wagon towards an open flat of rock at the edge of the docks. Judging by the number of people and the effort required, the crates were unimaginably heavy. A man stood at the bow of the boat, calling down orders to the crew and thrusting a stern finger towards the top of the volcano.

The sphere that Denri and the others were riding began to rumble. Weakly at first, but soon there was a steady vibration running up the cable and shaking the glass in its frame. Everyone on the docks paused and looked up. Several crews ran to help the sailors struggling with the crates.

"Uh... guys...?"

Before Denri could get any further, there was a loud crash as a plume of rock and lava erupted from the top of the mountain. A serpentine form, 50 feet long at least, emerged from the spray.

Black scales glistened in the soft red glow as the iron dragon uncoiled from the pools of lava and swam into the sky, heavy rivulets of molten stone dripping from its back and claws.

Denri felt her stomach grow cold as the creature snaked down to the docks. The whiskers on either side of its face snapping back and forth as it tasted the air. Denri pressed back against the people behind her, who were craning to see below. For some reason they were chattering excitedly.

"I didn't know there was a Gifting today. I've never seen Tetsujin emerge before!"

"Isn't he splendid? They say he answers to no one but the Twins."

The crew below had wrestled their crates onto the stone clearing, though they were still a ways from the center. As they saw Tetsujin approach, the men and women dropped their leads and fled back to their ship.

Tetsujin's body coiled around the crates like a mother protecting her children. His head reared up and a gout of silver flame erupted from his mouth, blanketing the crates. The wood caught instantly, burning away before Denri could blink.

The inside was filled with what Denri assumed were iron ingots. They glowed dull red, then orange, then white, and began to melt. Liquid iron spilled over Tetsujin's body, dripping from his scales. To Denri's horror, a laugh like crackling flame washed up from the dragon as he plunged his body into the molten ore.

When he emerged, Tetsujin was gleaming. The iron had fused with his scales, turning him a pure silver, yet his body still moved with the supple undulations of a snake. He made one final circle over the docks before he turned back to the mouth of the volcano. Denri's body shook as she watched the dragon's talons, now shining metal blades, disappear beneath the surface of the lava.

She pressed her way back through the crowd until she found Eizo and Aki. "Th-that thing lives beneath them?"

Aki still stared towards place where Tetsujin disappeared, her eyes alight. "He was beautiful!"

"Beautiful! That thing is a monster! It's not safe here."

A woman in a dragon mask - Denri suddenly understood the imagery - looked down and spoke in a soothing tone. "Do not worry, child. Tetsujin has lived in Kazora for over 300 years without issue. He serves the Twins without question. The heat he generates is what keeps the city aloft."

Eizo's hand rested on her shoulder. "Remember, focus on what it _is_, not what your mind fears it to be."

Denri nodded queasily. Not a dragon. Just a lump of scaly flesh. A _big_ lump of scaly, muscly flesh. She took a deep breath. He served the Twins, so he wasn't all powerful. His teeth and talons were bone, just like her. The metal coating his body was the same as Eizo's sword.

Denri swallowed hard and looked towards Sky Furnace as it approached from above. Her breathing slowed, though her chest remained tight and her cheeks hot. Tetsujin was frightening, but he was a creature like any other. They had no business with him, and he had no reason to single them out.

"Why does Tetsujin serve the Twins? Why doesn't he just leave?" Aki's face was obscured behind her mask, but her voice sounded tense.

The woman who spoke earlier turned to Aki. "The legends say that before the Twins were Champions, they challenged Tetsujin at the summit of the volcano and defeated him. They built their forges around the heat of his lair. When they won the Tournament, they chose Kazora as their domain. And as a gift for their allegiance, Amaterasu bound Tetsujin to serve them."

"So it was Tetsujin's home first and the Twins took it?"

"That's right. The Twins are very strong." The woman answered cheerfully, unaware of the accusations in Aki's voice.

"That's not--."

Eizo placed a hand on Aki's shoulder, the scars along his wrist and knuckles going white as he gave her a firm squeeze. "My daughter is very curious. Thank you for the story."

The woman bobbed her head and turned back to the front. Aki fumed quietly.

Denri stepped out of the lift and breathed the open air deeply, trying to calm her nerves from earlier. She coughed. This high up, there was a steady breeze cutting across Sky Furnace. But it couldn't completely rid the city of the sulfurous haze from the volcano below.

Denri did her best to keep her eyes from drifting to the dragon's lair below, distracting herself with the surroundings of the city itself.

It was hard to really call it a city. It was just too weird. The ground rocked and swayed like a ship at anchor. And the buildings built atop the floating platforms looked more like contraptions than shops and homes. The building to Denri's right was ticking loudly as it rotated on a giant interlocking gear mechanism.

Three streets away, an entire block detached in a hiss of steam and began to float away.

They stepped down from the lift platform and walked around the ticking house to a bridge that crossed onto a park. A large metal tree stood at the park's center, with branches that moved in mechanical jerks that approximated limbs swaying in the wind. A fence surrounded the tree, keeping passersby from the large vents of steam that periodically shot from the joints.

Eizo caught the attention of a local crossing perpendicular to them.

"Hello." The woman's response was deadpan, even compared to Eizo.

"We were hoping to find a fairly specialized piece of equipment. Could I trouble you for some directions?"

"No. I do not track the coming and goings of the zeppelins. I am unlikely to know the current configuration well enough to guide you."

"Perhaps just the names of some people to seek out, then?"

The woman shook her head a fraction of an inch. "I cannot say for certain who is still docked."

Denri threw up her hands in frustration. "Sheesh, try to be a little less helpful why don't you."

The woman's eye's narrowed briefly behind her mask before they returned to normal. "I speak the facts as they are known to me. Speculation is prohibited in Sky Furnace."

"Is there some sort of problem here?" Metallic footsteps approached from behind and Denri turned to see a tall man in golden armor wearing a roaring dragon mask. There were several others like him patrolling the nearby platforms.

"No, of course not." The woman glowered at Denri but quickly let the expression pass. "I was telling these individuals that I did not have enough information to offer them directions."

"I see." He nodded to the woman. "Thank you, you may leave."

The woman bowed as she backed away, then turned stiffly and walked away.

"The Arbiters are briefed on the general layout of Sky Furnace each morning, so I will guide you. What are you looking for?"

Denri looked to Eizo. She got the sense he should do the talking while they were here.

"We were hoping to purchase some tracking equipment that we saw a group of heroes using. We do not know who made the equipment, but we know it was made here."

"There are several zeppelins currently docked that sell tracking equipment. They are scattered, though."

"I believe the heroes hailed from Sadashi's domain, so they likely purchased the equipment there. Perhaps we can focus on shops that do business with Jidoka?"

"That won't be possible." Denri sighed and rolled her eyes, earning a sharp look from the Arbiter before he continued. "Zeppelins are not allowed to display their affiliations while in Sky Furnace, and you are likewise forbidden from asking. Neutrality is key to Sky Furnace's continued function."

"Ah, I suppose that makes sense. A broader list is fine then. We don't mind walking. And a recommendation for a good inn while we're searching."

The guard made them a list of names and gave the general locations of each. "The Dragon's Den is one platform away from the Hub Spring. It will be easiest if you navigate to and from the center for each shop. Outsiders are not advised to try navigating the rim platforms."

Eizo nodded and thanked the man. They turned to make their way.

"Also. In the future please direct questions and complaints to the Arbiters. We do not encourage negotiations between citizens directly, and public disturbances are strictly prohibited." He looked at Denri pointedly.

They followed the Arbiter's directions to the Dragon's Den and found themselves standing on a flat, grass-covered platform criss-crossed with steel-cobbled walkways and a few benches looking out over the edges. A large statue, two times Eizo's height, stood at the center depicting a dragon coiled around a mound of treasure. It's claws gripped a horse-sized ornate chest protectively.

"Perhaps we made a wrong turn?"

"I don't think so. He said it was next to the Hub Spring." Denri gestured to the adjacent zeppelin, dominated by a circular fountain at it's center that shot a wide plume of water up and over the edges of the platform. The people walking beneath the spring wavered behind the sheets of water. "If that's not the Hub Spring then I officially give up on understanding this place."

They milled about the platform uncomfortably, meandering down the steel pathways as they watched for signs of another outsider who might know something they didn't. Eventually they came to rest in one of the benches at the edge of the zeppelin, chatting idly as they waited.

Eizo sat stiff-backed, though Denri wasn't sure if the tension was from spending time idly or from Onara. Immediately after sitting, the black cat had slinked down from her position atop Eizo's pack, stretching luxuriously and commandeering his lap.

"OK, I have to know what the deal is with you and cats. Onara loves you, but you act like the 9-tails himself is curled across your lap. What gives?"

"I have said before, I do not like cats."

Denri rolled her eyes, stretching out and placing her feet on the back of the bench near Eizo's shoulders. "Yeah, I've gathered as much. But why?" Denri flapped an arm at Aki. "Do you know anything?"

The young girl was laying on the ground in front of the bench, near the edge of the platform. Her eyes were closed behind the mask and she didn't respond to the question. Denri pointed a finger at her toes and arced a small charge. Aki jumped.

"Hmm?" She opened her eyes and Denri saw Shiri shake his head a few feet away before continuing his explorations. "Sorry, I was practicing. What was the question?"

"Do you know why Eizo hates cats so much?"

Aki shrugged. "I think it's because they're soft and cuddly and he's sharp and pointy."

Denri stroked the chin of her mask in mock deliberation. "That must be it - he's protecting his image. When Onara sits in his lap it's like wrapping the hilt of a sword in big fluffy furs. Ridiculous."

Aki snorted behind her mask, then clamped her hands across the mouth when she saw Eizo bristle. She couldn't stop the giggles completely, though.

"Appearances are of little concern to me." His voice was laced with wounded dignity.

"Oh yeah, sure." Denri shoved Eizo's shoulder with a foot. "Why don't you tell us the real reason then? Otherwise I'll just start calling you Furblade."

"That does not even--." Eizo sighed and rubbed his eyes. "Very well. If you insist on prying, my first assignment with the Blades was at an outpost on the Cross in the mountains near Ninigi's Citadel. The area was filled with nekomata. I lost many friends to the demon cats." His voice was distant with memory.

Denri had never really thought of Eizo having friends before. Now that she tried, she couldn't imagine him sitting around the fire, joking with the other new recruits. He seemed like he had been hard his whole life. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up bad memories."

Eizo shook his head. "It is fine. Perhaps it is best I overcome these mental barriers." He looked down at Onara and gave her a more earnest pet. She looked up at him and yawned, then rolled onto her back. He scratched her stomach a few times before continuing.

"They aren't bad memories. Not really. Some are sad, but they come from a time when it felt like the violence, the deaths, did something good. I was more content in that outpost, even on the worst days, than I ever was in command."

Command? Eizo's tone did not invite further questions, but Denri was dying with curiosity. She was weighing the risks of probing deeper when Aki changed the subject.

"What is the Cross?"

"The Imperial Crossroads. You have seen them at least once before when we first met: the constructed pathway that you were being transported on when I tried to free you and Danzo captured us both."

"Oh yeah, I remember that! Why were you guarding it? It was just a path through the woods."

"The Cross is far more important than that. Most domains are completely disconnected from one another. A merchant or a family may occasionally hire a group of heroes to escort them through the wilderness, but for the most part each domain is self sufficient. Even in larger domains with a few towns, trade between them can be dangerous.

"But Ninigi had the Imperial Crossroads built to connect the domains of the champions that follow him. And he has the Blades guard it so that anyone can travel them. They are one of a kind."

"Why don't the other gods build their own roads?"

"They don't really care about connecting their domains. And if they did, none of them have a large force like the Blades to protect it. Even _with_ the Blades, Ninigi probably couldn't have done it if not for Sadashi's Penance."

Denri had been zoning during Eizo's geography lesson, but she perked up at the name. "Isn't Sadashi the champion who's chasing us? What's this penance about?"

Eizo nodded. "The Warlord. Sadashi's domain is on the border of a great lake. So great, in fact, that two other domains were also founded on its shores. Several hundred years ago, Sadashi decided to wage war and conquer them."

"Wait, but that's against the rules, right? No god or champion can interfere with another's domain."

"Sadashi decided to test that. His Blades quickly overwhelmed the other two domains. Then he set his sights more broadly."

"Why didn't the gods just destroy his armies? There's no way he could have stood against all five of them."

"The gods are not as united as they once were. A thousand years of squabbling over the Tournament has left them territorial. Ninigi helped stop Sadashi's conquest, but beyond that he was loathe to let one of his champions die. Or even to give up the newly acquired domains.

"No one wanted the level of destruction that would come from a war between the gods, so they made a deal. Sadashi could keep the two domains he conquered, so long as their original champions still had a say in their governance.

"But as punishment for his aggression, nearly all of the Blades that Sadashi received from Ninigi were forced to build and guard the Imperial Crossroads. His army was crippled, spread thin across Yosai. And Ninigi swore that if Sadashi or any of his champions ever broke the rules again, the roads would be used to bring all of the Blades to attack and destroy them."

"It seems like Ninigi got the best of everyone, then. He keeps the two domains _and_ gets a bunch of roads?"

"You underestimate Sadashi's strength. The five gods were able to halt his advance, but if Ninigi had supported him, it would have been far closer than the others would have you believe."

Aki sat up, looking frightened. "Is Sadashi really that powerful?"

"There has never been a champion like him. It is said that during the True Combat of Sadashi's Tournament, half of the Sanyaku pledged fealty to him and fought on his behalf. He won without a single scratch.

"Perhaps the Four Seasons together could oppose him. But he is a force beyond comprehension. And he has broken the rules of the Tournament in the past.

"That is why I have been set on learning the nature of Aki's powers. Why does Sadashi pursue her? I must assume that he is reluctant to break the rules again, with his armies weakened and Ninigi's promise of enforcement.

"But what if his ambition has returned? Does Aki play some part in that? Is she worth such a risk to him? Without knowing, we could be caught completely unaware."

Aki sniffed behind her mask. Her eyes shined with tears and her shoulders were shaking. Denri shot a glare at Eizo then got to the ground and placed an arm around her shoulders.

"Hey, there's no need to worry. I fought off the Blades once and I'll do it again if I have to. These things are only scary because we don't know what they really mean. Isn't that what you say, Eizo? Someone in this city knows at least part of what's going on. They have to if they can make that tracker we saw the Blades using.

"So we'll find that person and I'll zap them until they tell us what we want to know so we can avoid the danger. And eventually the two of us will be strong enough that nobody can mess with us anyways."

"Y-you promise?"

Denri charged her fingertips and tickled Aki until she started to giggle. "I promise, kid."
