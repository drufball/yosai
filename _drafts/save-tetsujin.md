Eizo was right about the chaos. Crews were running around barking orders so loud it was hard for Denri to hear her own thoughts. If the docks hadn't been mostly full of flits, she probably would have been trampled. It was wonderful.

Captain Hama had docked midway down the right side of Kazora's crescent-bay port, forcing them to walk a ways through the docks. Denri was out ahead, swaggering forward with the unsteady, bow-legged gait of a long time sailor back on land. She grinned, catcalling the younger boys she saw darting into ships just like her mom always used to.

Aki and Eizo plodded along behind her. Eizo scanning the crowd with his hand on his sword. Aki staring at Denri with wide eyes and mouth agape.

They haggled a set of masks off a kid sitting on a crate near a particularly battered hot-iron. Aki was disappointed when the only options depicted a stylized dragon with a blank expression. But at least there was some selection of colors.

The only way off the docks and up to the city was a large cable at the back of the port. A glass sphere the size of several carts lumbered up and down the tether. They were shoved unceremoniously into the transport when it was their turn.

Denri squirmed her way through the crowd of passengers and pressed her face against the glass for one last look below. She smiled at the frenetic energy of the sailors crawling over their ships.

The trip had been too short, but Denri made a resolution to herself. Somehow, before this was all over, she was going to get a boat.

As she was fantasizing about a life at sea, a flurry of activity caught Denri's eye. On the the far left side of the crescent bay, a ship was being unloaded with unusual energy. The crew was tugging at a number of large crates, stumbling over one another in their haste.

They were dragging three crates bigger than a wagon towards an open flat of rock at the end of the docks. Judging by the number of people and the effort required, the crates were unimaginably heavy. A man stood at the bow of the boat, calling down orders to the crew and thrusting a panicked finger towards the top of the volcano.

The sphere that Denri and the others were riding began to rumble. Weakly at first, but soon there was a steady vibration running up the cable and shaking the glass in its frames. Everyone on the docks paused and looked up. Several crews ran to help the sailors struggling with the crates.

"Uh... guys...?"

Before Denri could get any further, there was a loud crash as a small plume of rock and lava erupted from the top of the mountain as a 50 foot long, serpentine form emerged from the spray.

Black-grey scales glistened in the soft red glow as the iron dragon uncoiled from the pools of lava and swam into the sky, heavy rivulets of molten stone dripping from its back and claws.

Denri felt her stomach grow cold as the creature snaked down to the docks. The whiskers on either side of its face snapping back and forth as it tasted the air. Denri pressed back against the people behind her, who were craning to see below. For some reason the fools were chattering excitedly.

"I didn't know there was a Gifting today. I've never seen Tetsujin emerge before!"

"Isn't he splendid? They say no one but the Twins can command him."

The crew below had finally wrestled the crates onto the flat stone area, though they were still a ways from the center. As they saw Tetsujin approach, the men and women dropped their leads and fled back to their ship.

Tetsujin's body coiled around the crates like a mother protecting her children. His head reared up and a gout of silver flame erupted from his mouth, blanketing the crates. The wood caught instantly, burning away before Denri could blink.

Within were countless iron ingots. They soon glowed with their own heat and began to melt, liquid iron spilling over Tetsujin's body, dripping from his scales. To Denri's horror, a laugh like crackling flame washed up from the dragon as he plunged his body into the molten ore.

When he emerged, Tetsujin was gleaming. The iron had fused with his scales, turning him a pure silver, yet his body still moved with the supple undulations of a snake. He made one final circle over the docks before he turned back to the mouth of the volcano. Denri's body shook as she watched the dragon's talons, now shining metal blades, disappear beneath the surface of the lava.

She pressed her way back through the crowd until she found Eizo and Aki. "Th-that thing lives beneath them?"

Aki still stared towards place where Tetsujin disappeared, her eyes alight. "He was beautiful!"

"Beautiful! That thing is a monster! It's not safe here."

A woman in a dragon mask - Denri suddenly understood the imagery - looked down at Denri and spoke in a soothing tone. "Do not worry, child. Tetsujin has lived in Kazora for over 300 years without issue. He serves the Twins without question. The heat he generates is what keeps the city aloft!"

Eizo's hand rested on her shoulder. "Remember, focus on what it _is_, not what your mind fears it to be."

Denri nodded queasily. Right. Not a dragon. Just a lump of scaly flesh. A _big_ lump of scaly, muscly flesh. She took a deep breath. He served the Twins, so he could be beaten. His teeth and talons were bone, just like her. The metal coating his body was the same as Eizo's sword.

Denri swallowed hard and looked towards Sky Furnace as it approached from above. Her breathing slowed, though her chest remained tight and her cheeks hot. Tetsujin was frightening, but he was a creature like any other. They had no business with him, and he had no reason to single them out.

<AKI ASKS ABOUT TETSUJIN BEING BOUND AND GETS MAD>

Denri stepped out of the lift and breathed the open air deeply, trying to calm her nerves. She coughed. This high up, there was a steady breeze cutting across Sky Furnace. But it couldn't completely rid the city of the sulfurous, hazy feel from the volcano below.

"Great." Denri did her best to keep her eyes from drifting down to the dragon's lair below. She distracted herself with the surroundings of the city itself.

It was hard for Denri to really call it a city. It was just too weird. The ground rocked and swayed like a ship in a doldrum. And the buildings built atop the floating platforms looked more like contraptions than shops and homes. The building do Denri's right was ticking loudly as it rotated on a giant interlocking gear mechanism.

Three streets away, an entire block detached in a hiss of steam and began to float away.

They stepped down from the lift platform and walked around the ticking house to a bridge that crossed onto a park platform.

Eizo caught the attention of a local. "Excuse me."

"Greetings." The woman's deadpan response made Eizo look like an emotional hot head in comparison.

"We were hoping to buy a fairly specialized piece of equipment. Could I trouble you for some directions?"

"No. I do not track the coming and goings of the zeppelins, so I am unlikely to know the current configuration well enough to guide you."

"Perhaps just the names of some people to seek out, then?"

The woman shook her head a fraction of an inch. "I cannot say for certain who is still docked."

Denri threw up her hands in frustration. "Sheesh, try to be a little less helpful why don't you."

The woman's eye's widened briefly behind her mask and she took a step back. She looked over Denri's shoulder at the sound of metallic footsteps.

"Is there some sort of problem here?" Denri turned to see a tall man in golden armor, wearing a golden dragon mask. There were many more like him patrolling the platforms.

"No, of course not." The woman narrowed her eyes at Denri but quickly let the expression pass. "I was telling these individuals that I did not have enough information to offer them directions."

"I see." The guard seemed to notice the Denri and the woman's agitation. He nodded to the woman. "Thank you, you may leave. The Arbiters are briefed on the general layout of Sky Furnace each morning, so I will guide you."

The woman bowed slightly and excused herself. The arbiter turned his full attention towards them. "What are you looking for?"

Denri looked to Eizo. After that response, she got the sense he should do the talking while they were here.

"We have need of some advanced tracking equipment. I would be grateful if you could direct us towards anyone who specializes in sensing or amplification tools."

"I do not know of many, but there are a few currently docked. They are scattered, though."

"That's fine, we don't mind walking."

The guard made them a list of names and gave them general directions to each. "It will be easiest to move to and from the Hub Spring between each visit. It is not advisable for outsiders to try navigating around the rim platforms."

Eizo nodded and they turned to make their way.

"Also. In the future please direct questions and complaints to the Arbiters. We do not encourage negotiations between citizens directly." He looked at Denri pointedly.

They spent the day crossing back and forth across Sky Furnace. The arbiter hadn't been kidding when he said the shops were scattered. It was sweaty work, trekking through the heated air above the volcano. And every rumble or sudden shift of the platforms sent Denri's eye down to where the iron dragon slept.

They were hoping for a lead. Whoever built the Blades' sensor had some understanding of how Aki's power worked. So far every shop they entered had nothing but fancy compasses and alarms. And there were only two shops left on their list.

Denri was getting impatient.

They stepped into the second to last shop as the sun was beginning to set. The room they entered was simple, a few tables evenly spaced across the room with items for sale neatly on display. A spiral metal staircase led up to a second floor at the back. There was no one there.

"Maybe there's a bell or something to call--."

"Hello?" Denri called loudly, pounding her hand against the wall. She was tired of stepping on egg shells.

There was a clatter upstairs, followed by the sound of footsteps moving across the floor. A pair of legs appeared at the top of the steps and resolved themselves inch by inch into a heavyset man waddling down. The metal staircase groaned with each step.

He reached the bottom out of breath, pulling his mask away from his face and wiping sweat from his bald head with a brightly colored silk rag. The handkerchief disappeared up one of his loose sleeves after its use.

"May I help you? Speak quickly, I'm in the middle of an experiment."

"We were looking for any tracking equipment you might have for sale."

The man waved a dismissive hand towards the tables. "Yes, well my stock is on display. What you see is what I have."

"I'm sorry, we aren't familiar with many of these devices' functions. Many shops we visited have shown us things that can identify a creature's trail, or respond to movement. But we are looking for something that can detect someone's resonant bonds."

The man did a good job hiding his response. Especially with the mask, he didn't give away much of a sign. But Denri could tell. His shoulders tightened and he took a step back towards the staircase. She didn't need anymore sign. This was their guy.

"You'll have to look elsewhere, I don't have anything like that. If that's all, then I have work to complete. Please show yourselves out." The man turned and made his way back upstairs.

Eizo turned, shaking his head. "I suppose we have one more shop to check."

"No need. We found him."

"How do you know?"

"Did you see how that reacted? Immediately tense. He's hiding something."

"Denri, we need more to go on than 'he looked tense'."

"I'm telling you, it's him! Let's at least take a look around. Just a quick scan." Denri took a few heavy steps towards the door, then opened and closed it loudly. She put a finger over her lips.

She described what the tracking device looked like in a whisper and they started poking through the tables for anything with a similar construction. Eizo took one side, while Denri and Aki started at the other.

They were on the second table when Aki gasped. She dropped the device in her hands and pressed back against a table, getting as much distance as she could.

"Woah, kid, what's wrong?"

Aki pointed a trembling finger at the device. "I've seen that before."

"I thought I asked you to show yourselves out." There was the heavy sound of footsteps above, moving towards the staircase.

Eizo made his way over and picked up the device. He frowned. "I haven't seen anything like this in the other shops."

Aki was shaking like a leaf as she crouched behind Denri. The move was awkward given that Denri was shorter. She turned around to the girl and grabbed her face. "Hey, hey! It's OK. I'm not going to let anything happen to you."

Aki took a stuttering breath and calmed a bit as she looked into Denri's eyes. "That's my girl. Can you tell me what this thing does?"

"It- it hurts." Aki closed her eyes and tears rolled down her cheeks.

"Who used it on you?"

"The people who took care of me when I was growing up, I don't know their names or anything."

"What are you still doing here? Put that device down. I will call the Arbiters."

The man was standing back at the top of the steps. He hadn't bothered to put his mask on and he looked angry.

Eizo helped up his hands. "My apologies, we didn't mean any harm. We were just--."

There was a flash of sparks as Denri appeared behind the heavyset man, anger writ across her face. Her muscles flared as she charged her body, then grabbed the back of the man's robes and through him into the ceiling.

The wooden roof buckled and the man fell heavily to the ground at her feet. He coughed weakly.

"Denri!" Eizo began to charge for the steps. She ignored him and lifted the man to his knees.

"I've had a pretty stressful day, and I'm getting tired of all these delicate questions. Unlucky for you, you sell things that hurt my friends. So I'm going to ask this once and frost take you if you tell me you don't know what I'm talking about."

The man nodded nervously, his hands held out in deference.

"Who do you sell that device to?"

"I don't--"

Denri threw the man across the second story room. His heavy body smashed through the wooden wall. There was a heavy _thud_ as he hit the ground outside. Whoops.

"What are you doing Denri?" Eizo sounded panicked as he ran up the stairs.

No going back now. "I'm winging it." She ran forward and jumped through the hole in the wall.

There were shouts from the streets around them as Denri knelt over her prey. Blood trailed from his mouth and one of his arms was bent at a bad angle. Denri held up her hand and sparks danced across her fingers like a bared blade.

"I don't have much time. Last chance."

The man held his hands up. "No, wait! Please! Emiko. She buys them! Please don't kill me!"

"Thanks." Denri slapped the man across the face. His body tensed from the electric shock and he fell unconscious.

"Don't move!" Several arbiters were walking toward her warily, blades drawn. They had the entire building surrounded.

Denri looked up to Eizo, who was standing by the hole in the wall and looking down at the guards. "Well, that escalated, huh?" He didn't laugh.

"Doesn't look like we have much choice, but I think I found a pretty good debut." Denri turned back toward the approaching arbiters. She threw a trail of sparks in the air and yelled as loud as she could.

"My name is Denri, an unranked tournament competitor. And I challenge the Twins!"
