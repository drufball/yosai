Eizo was right about the chaos. Crews were running around barking orders so loud it was hard for Denri to hear her own thoughts. If the docks hadn't been mostly full of flits, she probably would have been trampled. It was wonderful.

Captain Hama had docked midway down the right side of Kazora's crescent-bay port, forcing them to walk a ways towards the center tether that lead to Sky Furnace. Denri was out ahead, swaggering forward with the unsteady, bow-legged gait of a long time sailor back on land. She grinned, berating the younger ship hands darting across decks and into holds. Just like her mom always used to.

It was an act, but a fun one at that.

Aki and Eizo plodded along behind her. Eizo scanning the crowd with his hand on his sword. Aki staring at Denri with wide eyes and mouth agape.

Denri haggled a set of masks from a kid sitting on a crate near a battered hot-iron covered in a patchwork of repairs. Aki was disappointed the only option was a stylized dragon with a blank expression. But at least there was some selection of colors.

The only way off the docks and up to the city was a large cable at the back of port. A glass sphere the size of several carts lumbered up and down the tether. They were shoved unceremoniously into the transport when it was their turn.

Denri squirmed through the crowd of passengers and pressed her face against the glass for one last look below. She smiled at the frenetic energy of the sailors crawling across their ships.

The voyage had been short, but Denri made a resolution to herself. Somehow, before this was all over, she was going to get a boat.

As she was fantasizing about a life at sea, a flurry of activity caught her eye. On the the far left side of the crescent bay, a ship was being unloaded with panicked intensity. The crew was tugging at a number of large crates, stumbling over one another in their haste.

They were dragging three crates bigger than a wagon towards an open flat of rock at the edge of the docks. Judging by the number of people and the effort required, the crates were unimaginably heavy. A man stood at the bow of the boat, calling down orders to the crew and thrusting a stern finger towards the top of the volcano.

The sphere that Denri and the others were riding began to rumble. Weakly at first, but soon there was a steady vibration running up the cable and shaking the glass in its frame. Everyone on the docks paused and looked up. Several crews ran to help the sailors struggling with the crates.

"Uh... guys...?"

Before Denri could get any further, there was a loud crash as a plume of rock and lava erupted from the top of the mountain. A serpentine form, 50 feet long at least, emerged from the spray.

Black scales glistened in the soft red glow as the iron dragon uncoiled from the pools of lava and swam into the sky, heavy rivulets of molten stone dripping from its back and claws.

Denri felt her stomach grow cold as the creature snaked down to the docks. The whiskers on either side of its face snapping back and forth as it tasted the air. Denri pressed back against the people behind her, who were craning to see below. For some reason they were chattering excitedly.

"I didn't know there was a Gifting today. I've never seen Tetsujin emerge before!"

"Isn't he splendid? They say he answers to no one but the Twins."

The crew below had wrestled their crates onto the stone clearing, though they were still a ways from the center. As they saw Tetsujin approach, the men and women dropped their leads and fled back to their ship.

Tetsujin's body coiled around the crates like a mother protecting her children. His head reared up and a gout of silver flame erupted from his mouth, blanketing the crates. The wood caught instantly, burning away before Denri could blink.

The inside was filled with what Denri assumed were iron ingots. They glowed dull red, then orange, then white, and began to melt. Liquid iron spilled over Tetsujin's body, dripping from his scales. To Denri's horror, a laugh like crackling flame washed up from the dragon as he plunged his body into the molten ore.

When he emerged, Tetsujin was gleaming. The iron had fused with his scales, turning him a pure silver, yet his body still moved with the supple undulations of a snake. He made one final circle over the docks before he turned back to the mouth of the volcano. Denri's body shook as she watched the dragon's talons, now shining metal blades, disappear beneath the surface of the lava.

She pressed her way back through the crowd until she found Eizo and Aki. "Th-that thing lives beneath them?"

Aki still stared towards place where Tetsujin disappeared, her eyes alight. "He was beautiful!"

"Beautiful! That thing is a monster! It's not safe here."

A woman in a dragon mask - Denri suddenly understood the imagery - looked down and spoke in a soothing tone. "Do not worry, child. Tetsujin has lived in Kazora for over 300 years without issue. He serves the Twins without question. The heat he generates is what keeps the city aloft."

Eizo's hand rested on her shoulder. "Remember, focus on what it _is_, not what your mind fears it to be."

Denri nodded queasily. Not a dragon. Just a lump of scaly flesh. A _big_ lump of scaly, muscly flesh. She took a deep breath. He served the Twins, so he wasn't all powerful. His teeth and talons were bone, just like her. The metal coating his body was the same as Eizo's sword.

Denri swallowed hard and looked towards Sky Furnace as it approached from above. Her breathing slowed, though her chest remained tight and her cheeks hot. Tetsujin was frightening, but he was a creature like any other. They had no business with him, and he had no reason to single them out.

"Why does Tetsujin serve the Twins? Why doesn't he just leave?" Aki's face was obscured behind her mask, but her voice sounded tense.

The woman who spoke earlier turned to Aki. "The legends say that before the Twins were Champions, they challenged Tetsujin at the summit of the volcano and defeated him. They built their forges around the heat of his lair. When they won the Tournament, they chose Kazora as their domain. And as a gift for their allegiance, Amaterasu bound Tetsujin to serve them."

"So it was Tetsujin's home first and the Twins took it?"

"That's right. The Twins are very strong." The woman answered cheerfully, unaware of the accusations in Aki's voice.

"That's not--."

Eizo placed a hand on Aki's shoulder, the scars along his wrist and knuckles going white as he gave her a firm squeeze. "My daughter is very curious. Thank you for the story."

The woman bobbed her head and turned back to the front. Aki fumed quietly.

Denri stepped out of the lift and breathed the open air deeply, trying to calm her nerves from earlier. She coughed. This high up, there was a steady breeze cutting across Sky Furnace. But it couldn't completely rid the city of the sulfurous haze from the volcano below.

Denri did her best to keep her eyes from drifting to the dragon's lair below, distracting herself with the surroundings of the city itself.

It was hard to really call it a city. It was just too weird. The ground rocked and swayed like a ship at anchor. And the buildings built atop the floating platforms looked more like contraptions than shops and homes. The building to Denri's right was ticking loudly as it rotated on a giant interlocking gear mechanism.

Three streets away, an entire block detached in a hiss of steam and began to float away.

They stepped down from the lift platform and walked around the ticking house to a bridge that crossed onto a park. A large metal tree stood at the park's center, with branches that moved in mechanical jerks that approximated limbs swaying in the wind. A fence surrounded the tree, keeping passersby from the large vents of steam that periodically shot from the joints.

Eizo caught the attention of a local crossing perpendicular to them.

"Greetings." The woman's response was deadpan, even compared to Eizo.

"We were hoping to find a fairly specialized piece of equipment. Could I trouble you for some directions?"

"No. I do not track the coming and goings of the zeppelins. I am unlikely to know the current configuration well enough to guide you."

"Perhaps just the names of some people to seek out, then?"

The woman shook her head a fraction of an inch. "I cannot say for certain who is still docked."

Denri threw up her hands in frustration. "Sheesh, try to be a little less helpful why don't you."

The woman's eye's narrowed briefly behind her mask before they returned to normal. "I speak the facts as they are known to me. Speculation is prohibited in Sky Furnace."

"Is there some sort of problem here?" Metallic footsteps approached from behind and Denri turned to see a tall man in golden armor wearing a roaring dragon mask. There were several others like him patrolling the nearby platforms.

"No, of course not." The woman glowered at Denri but quickly let the expression pass. "I was telling these individuals that I did not have enough information to offer them directions."

"I see." He nodded to the woman. "Thank you, you may leave."

The woman bowed as she backed away, then turned stiffly and walked away.

"The Arbiters are briefed on the general layout of Sky Furnace each morning, so I will guide you. What are you looking for?"

Denri looked to Eizo. She got the sense he should do the talking while they were here.

"We were hoping to purchase some tracking equipment that we saw a group of Heroes using. We do not know who made the equipment, but we know it was made here."

"There are several zeppelins currently docked that sell tracking equipment. They are scattered, though."

"I believe the heroes hailed from Sadashi's domain, so they likely purchased the equipment there. Perhaps we can focus on shops that do business with Jidoka?"

"That won't be possible." Denri sighed and rolled her eyes, earning a sharp look from the Arbiter before he continued. "Zeppelins are not allowed to display their affiliations while in Sky Furnace, and you are likewise forbidden from asking. Neutrality is key to Sky Furnace's continued function."

"Ah, I suppose that makes sense. A broader list is fine then. We don't mind walking. And a recommendation for a good inn while we search.

The guard made them a list of names and gave the general locations of each. "The Dragon's Den is just a platform away from the Hub Spring. It will be easiest if you navigate to and from the center for each shop. Outsiders are not advised to try navigating the rim platforms."

Eizo nodded and thanked the man. They turned to make their way.

"Also. In the future please direct questions and complaints to the Arbiters. We do not encourage negotiations between citizens directly, and public disturbances are strictly prohibited." He looked at Denri pointedly.

They followed the Arbiter's directions to the Dragon's Den and found themselves standing on a flat, grass-covered platform criss-crossed with steel-cobbled walkways and a few benches looking out over the edges. A large statue, two times Eizo's height, stood at the center. It depicted a dragon coiled around a mound of treasure, it's claws gripping a horse-sized ornate chest protectively.

"Perhaps we made a wrong turn?"

"I don't think so. He said it was next to the Hub Spring." Denri gestured to the adjacent platform, dominated by a circular fountain at it's center that shot a wide plume of water up and over the edges of the platform. The people walking beneath the spring wavered behind the sheets of water. "If that's not the Hub Spring then I officially give up on understanding this place."

<STOPPED WRITING HERE>

They spent the day crossing back and forth across Sky Furnace. The arbiter hadn't been kidding when he said the shops were scattered. It was sweaty work, trekking through the heated air above the volcano. And every rumble or sudden shift of the platforms sent Denri's eye down to where the iron dragon slept.

They were hoping for a lead. Whoever built the Blades' sensor had some understanding of how Aki's power worked. So far every shop they entered had nothing but fancy compasses and alarms. And there were only two shops left on their list.

Denri was getting impatient.

They stepped into the second to last shop as the sun was beginning to set. The room they entered was simple, a few tables evenly spaced across the room with items for sale neatly on display. A spiral metal staircase led up to a second floor at the back. There was no one there.

"Maybe there's a bell or something to call--."

"Hello?" Denri called loudly, pounding her hand against the wall. She was tired of stepping on egg shells.

There was a clatter upstairs, followed by the sound of footsteps moving across the floor. A pair of legs appeared at the top of the steps and resolved themselves inch by inch into a heavyset man waddling down. The metal staircase groaned with each step.

He reached the bottom out of breath, pulling his mask away from his face and wiping sweat from his bald head with a brightly colored silk rag. The handkerchief disappeared up one of his loose sleeves after its use.

"May I help you? Speak quickly, I'm in the middle of an experiment."

"We were looking for any tracking equipment you might have for sale."

The man waved a dismissive hand towards the tables. "Yes, well my stock is on display. What you see is what I have."

"I'm sorry, we aren't familiar with many of these devices' functions. Many shops we visited have shown us things that can identify a creature's trail, or respond to movement. But we are looking for something that can detect someone's resonant bonds."

The man did a good job hiding his response. Especially with the mask, he didn't give away much of a sign. But Denri could tell. His shoulders tightened and he took a step back towards the staircase. She didn't need anymore sign. This was their guy.

"You'll have to look elsewhere, I don't have anything like that. If that's all, then I have work to complete. Please show yourselves out." The man turned and made his way back upstairs.

Eizo turned, shaking his head. "I suppose we have one more shop to check."

"No need. We found him."

"How do you know?"

"Did you see how that reacted? Immediately tense. He's hiding something."

"Denri, we need more to go on than 'he looked tense'."

"I'm telling you, it's him! Let's at least take a look around. Just a quick scan." Denri took a few heavy steps towards the door, then opened and closed it loudly. She put a finger over her lips.

She described what the tracking device looked like in a whisper and they started poking through the tables for anything with a similar construction. Eizo took one side, while Denri and Aki started at the other.

They were on the second table when Aki gasped. She dropped the device in her hands and pressed back against a table, getting as much distance as she could.

"Woah, kid, what's wrong?"

Aki pointed a trembling finger at the device. "I've seen that before."

"I thought I asked you to show yourselves out." There was the heavy sound of footsteps above, moving towards the staircase.

Eizo made his way over and picked up the device. He frowned. "I haven't seen anything like this in the other shops."

Aki was shaking like a leaf as she crouched behind Denri. The move was awkward given that Denri was shorter. She turned around to the girl and grabbed her face. "Hey, hey! It's OK. I'm not going to let anything happen to you."

Aki took a stuttering breath and calmed a bit as she looked into Denri's eyes. "That's my girl. Can you tell me what this thing does?"

"It- it hurts." Aki closed her eyes and tears rolled down her cheeks.

"Who used it on you?"

"The people who took care of me when I was growing up, I don't know their names or anything."

"What are you still doing here? Put that device down. I will call the Arbiters."

The man was standing back at the top of the steps. He hadn't bothered to put his mask on and he looked angry.

Eizo helped up his hands. "My apologies, we didn't mean any harm. We were just--."

There was a flash of sparks as Denri appeared behind the heavyset man, anger writ across her face. Her muscles flared as she charged her body, then grabbed the back of the man's robes and through him into the ceiling.

The wooden roof buckled and the man fell heavily to the ground at her feet. He coughed weakly.

"Denri!" Eizo began to charge for the steps. She ignored him and lifted the man to his knees.

"I've had a pretty stressful day, and I'm getting tired of all these delicate questions. Unlucky for you, you sell things that hurt my friends. So I'm going to ask this once and frost take you if you tell me you don't know what I'm talking about."

The man nodded nervously, his hands held out in deference.

"Who do you sell that device to?"

"I don't--"

Denri threw the man across the second story room. His heavy body smashed through the wooden wall. There was a heavy _thud_ as he hit the ground outside. Whoops.

"What are you doing Denri?" Eizo sounded panicked as he ran up the stairs.

No going back now. "I'm winging it." She ran forward and jumped through the hole in the wall.

There were shouts from the streets around them as Denri knelt over her prey. Blood trailed from his mouth and one of his arms was bent at a bad angle. Denri held up her hand and sparks danced across her fingers like a bared blade.

"I don't have much time. Last chance."

The man held his hands up. "No, wait! Please! Emiko. She buys them! Please don't kill me!"

"Thanks." Denri slapped the man across the face. His body tensed from the electric shock and he fell unconscious.

"Don't move!" Several arbiters were walking toward her warily, blades drawn. They had the entire building surrounded.

Denri looked up to Eizo, who was standing by the hole in the wall and looking down at the guards. "Well, that escalated, huh?" He didn't laugh.

"Doesn't look like we have much choice, but I think I found a pretty good debut." Denri turned back toward the approaching arbiters. She threw a trail of sparks in the air and yelled as loud as she could.

"My name is Denri, an unranked tournament competitor. And I challenge the Twins!"
