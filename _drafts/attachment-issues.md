Gasp! It worked! Look at that. These colors! Where is this? A farm? The detail is unbelievable.

And if the resonance is right... Yes! All these memories. Incredible! Ooph, I did _not_ get a happy one. 

And Manabu said it wouldn't work. Well who's laughing now, eh brother? Me! I'm laughing! From now on it's two against one! No more embarrasing--. 

Huh? Wait, stop screaming. Hey! Shut up. Listen.

No seriously, stop freaking out. No, you're not going crazy. I just - cough, cough, splutter - Did you just throw water in your face? I felt it! I'm a GENIUS. The bond is even stronger than I expected. I wonder if I can...

Hey! Slap yourself in the face. 

No? I guess senses are the limit. At least you stopped screaming, though. That part wasn't fun. I'm going to have to figure out some kind of filter for people who startle easily. It's like, what, you've never had a second consciousness spontaneously sprout in your mind? What are you, some kind of farmer? Oh, I guess in this case... 

Hey! Would you mind looking around? I want to see if there are any distinguishing substances I could use to filter out people like you when I try this again.

What's that? You want to know what's going on? Don't worry about it. You're going crazy. Ooooh, I'm a ghoooost. Now pick up that rock and tell me if it tastes like it has a higher than normal zinc concentration or I'll eat your soulllll.

Ugh, this is taking too long. I have things to do! Manabu will be back soon with a location for the beast. I'll just have to figure something out for the filter on my own. Thanks for letting me share your head for a bit! Sorry you're all wet now. And for the screaming. 

Your life seems interesting. Super sad though. Hang in there, man. You keep on farming. Anyways, bye!

...

Phew! Mother's scales that guy was _dull_. Good thing it wasn't permanent like Manabu said it would be. Hah! Manabu, overcautious as always. That's why I'll be the last one standing at the Tournament's end.

I pull the metal band off my head and take a look at the cloudy white void stone inlaid at it's center. The stone is badly cracked. It fades to grey in my hands. Guess it's a single use.

I lay the headband on the heavy wooden table next to me. It's littered with half finished, badly broken, partially exploded metal mechanisms. Manabu won't notice one more amidst the pile.

I should probably put something together for the upcoming mission before Manabu gets back, otherwise he'll wonder what I was up to. I brush back my thick red robe and pull another void stone from my belt. This one flashes blue occasionally. A miniature thunderstorm crackles within the cloudy white depths. Why is it crackling like that?

That's a stupid question. It's holding my new seismic resonance, obviously. I guess it is pretty recent. Still getting used to the upgrade. I focus on the stone, letting my heart rate rise, stoking my impatience. _Frenetic_. The hairs all over my body stand on end for a minute as the harmonics reestablish themselves. The thunderstorm disappears from the stone in my hands.

I stow the void stone and walk to the large furnace across the room. I pull open the thick iron door, one hand blocking the searing heat from my face. A few ingots lay amongst the coals, ready in case the inspiration for something fun strikes me unexpectedly.

Right, time to whip up something quick for the mission. What was the mission again? 

We're hunting down Reiko's source. Sheesh, what's wrong with me? I feel like some of that farmer's dumb rubbed off on me. I need to pull it together before Manabu gets back or he'll suspect something.

Manabu. I keep saying that name. Who is that?

My twin brother! Honestly, how could the effects be this extreme this long after-- oh.

You're still here, aren't you?

Don't just say yes like some kind of idiot! Do you have any idea what this means? Of course you don't. You're a farmer. It means Manabu was RIGHT. Ughhh. He's going to be so frosting _smug_. I can just imagine that stupid, imperious face of his. First he'll be like _I told you the link could be permanent._ Then he'll be all _We don't know how void stones react with sentient resonances. You should have waited until we understood more._ 

Hey! Could you try to be a little less confused? It's seeping over the bond and it feels... weird. Is this how normal people usually feel?

Wait, you're here with _me_! The link can go two ways? That's fascinating. We didn't expect that. Maybe you've got some sort of-- seriously! Knock it off with the panic and the questions! How am I supposed to think?

Fine! If I explain things to you, will you be quiet? Alright, shut up for a minute and let me check your memories to see how much you already know... Gasp. You don't know _anything_. I can't believe this. You were supposed to be my secret weapon.

OK. Where to start. So, you know the Grand Tournament? All those powerful people fighting to be the next Champion? First things first, I'm one of those people. The name's Hideki. My brother and I just got chosen by Amaterasu as her favored warriors. Yeah, chosen by a god. We're kind of a big deal. If you'd ever left your farm you'd probably have heard of us.

Anyways, have you ever wondered where we all get our crazy powers? Ugh. Of course you haven't. Look, I get it OK? You live a hard life with more important things to worry about than the latest tournament gossip. You're so frosting _rustic_. Could you at least _pretend_ like there's a bone of intellectual curiosity in your body?

People have powers. They can do incredible things. That is now relevant to you.

Our abilities come from something called resonance. People with powers, we call them anchors. They draw their power from some source of energy that exists in the world. Imagine a raging river or an area with a lot of seismic activity. We call those sources of power surges. Between the anchor and the surge is a bond. An anchor can pull energy out of their surge, across the bond, and then manifest that energy around them. 

With me so far? Nod if you understand. Hah! See, I _can_ control your body.

OK, so an anchor pulls energy out of a surge, across a bond. To form a bond, you have to be physically near a surge and you also have to share some sort of ideal with it. For a river you could be relentless. Or you might be chaotic like the seismic activity. It doesn't matter what, so long as there's a strong similarity. 

In theory, anyone can form a bond. But it's very physically and mentally taxing. You can't bond with more than one thing at a time. Even a lot of really powerful people can only do it subconsciously. But some people, like my brother and I, are able to exert some concious control over our bonds. We're adepts. Most people can only pull power from their source in a fixed way. But people like my brother and I can alter the energy as it's coming across, warping the effects a bit.

Imagine the string of a guitar. Wait... OK, _phew_. At least you've heard music before. 

So imagine the string of a guitar. Most people, all they can do is pluck a string. Well, no. _Most_ people don't even own a guitar. But ignore them. People who resonate subconsciously, it's like all they can do it pluck a string. They only get one sound. But adepts, we can put our hands on the guitar. We can pinch the string in places to create new notes that have different sounds and feelings to it. 

Hey - this is a pretty good analogy isn't it? I should tell Manabu about it. He'll wanna write it down.

Where was I? Right, adepts can make more notes. At first, we can only use one finger to change the sound. But as an adept gets stronger, they can use more and more fingers to alter the resonance. Ultimately, there are 6 harmonics that we can apply to our bond. There's different ways each harmonic can be used, but each level has a certain quality to it. The first harmonic, for example, is malleability. It lets you bend and shape the energy you manifest. Instead of throwing a big ball of fire, using the first harmonic you could make it into a whip, or shape it to avoid your friends.

The most important harmonic is the third harmonic. Well, it's certainly the most important one for this conversation. But it's my favorite harmonic anyways. The third harmonic is polarity. The bond between surge and anchor has two end points. Usually, those endpoints are the surge and the anchor. But those endpoints also have a sort of directionality to them. And usually, the directionality is from the surge to the anchor.

Without the third harmonic, well, things would be pretty boring. Energy would only flow one way, and when you manifested that energy, it would always have to originate from your body.

What do you mean I'm over-explaining? This is all interesting stuff!

Whatever. With the polarity harmonic, you can do things that alter the poles of a bond. For example, you could reverse the directionality, letting you absorb energy around you and transfer it back to your surge. Or you could flare a pole out of your body temporarily, allowing you to create an effect that doesn't originate from you.

And that's it. Happy? No over-explaining. 

Oh? You don't get how that leads to us living inside each others' heads? Wow. It's like this stuff is complicated and requires a pretty thorough explanation, huh? Jerk.

So in simple terms, I used two polarity harmonics at the same time. The first harmonic let me create another endpoint. I look across the room to the thick wooden table where I set the metal headrest. That acted as an amplifier, but it's tough to aim at that kind of distance, so I just sort of connected to something at random.

I look back down, returning to my work. A long, serrated blade lays in my lap. An opalescent void stone rests in the hilt, surrounded by a series of gears running along the back of the blade. One of the gears is stuck so I remove it and start rooting through the surrounding scraps for a smaller one.

What do you mean 'where did this come from?' I've been making it while we talked! You think I have enough time to just sit here and lecture farmers all day? Sheesh. Somebody's got a high opinion of himself.

Anyways, I used that amplifier over there to create and project a third endpoint into your head. Then I used another harmonic to reverse the flow at the same time that I broke off the connection with my surge. The idea was that if I dropped the surge endpoint, I'd be left with a bipolar connection directed from you to me. Sound familiar? Wait, seriously? No? It sounds like a normal resonance bond! 

You're the surge, I'm the anchor. If it worked, the process would allow me to create artificial resonance bonds quickly and at huge distances.

The only problem is that resonating with an intelligent surge - I use the term _loosely_ in your case - is always sort of tricky. Both sides can mess with the bond. Usually, the only intelligent surges are gods or Champions. They're entities strong enough to dominate the bond and cancel out any subconscious resistance a new anchor might put up.

Manabu worried that the process for artificial resonance might create a closed loop bond. Remember how I said a resonant bond requires some sort of ideological symmetry? Well, when I connected the two of us, we both started reflexively trying to adapt to the bond. Like how you catch your balance when you stumble. We both tried to warp the bond to our own personality while trying to shift ourselves as well. We're just chasing each other in circles trying to stabilize the bond. And because it can't stabilize, I can't end it.

I told Manabu that we might be able to break the closed loop by transferring my half of the bond into a void stone. I tap the hilt of the sword in my hands. These crystals are completely blank when it comes to resonance. They can hold a bond with anything. Manabu and I invented them.

Which - ugh - it's a pretty big deal! Basically, Manabu and I can use the third harmonic to transfer our half of a resonant bond into the stone. The stone latches on and we're free to resonate with a different surge. But we can still pull energy out of the void stone. True, we can't pull it out at full strength. The void stone is pretty much permanently stuck at a first level harmonic. But we're the only people in the world who can access the power of multiple surges! That's why Amaterasu is so interested in us.

Anyways, I thought if I used the void stone that was set into the amplifier as an interface between us, the bond would stabilize. 

And look. I'm just gonna give it to you straight. I was wrong. The void stone shattered trying to hold two ideals at once. We got stuck in a closed loop resonance. Manabu was right. Nobody is happy about it.

Now, do you want the good news, or the bad news first? 

Ugh. A pessimist. _Figures_.

The bad news is that our minds are stuck linked. Probably forever. Because both of us are sort of maintaining the bond at the same time, though, it's not as physically taxing. So I can still resonate with other things. Yea, I know that only applies to me! I'm just saying.

And plus, there is some benefit for you. Good news time. The bond isn't fully formed, but it's still circulating energy between us. Probably not enough for you to do any cool magic. But it's probably enough to sustain your body like it does mine. You don't need to eat anymore! And you're _probably_ immortal. Very long-lived at the least.

Pretty sweet deal, right? Think of all the farming you'll be able to do!

Don't you think you're overreacting a little? Hey! I can hear your thoughts you know. Sheesh, if it bugs you so much just try not to think about it. So long as neither of us thinks about it, the bond should fade into the background a bit. Our emotional states will still bleed across, but conscious thoughts won't come across. 

I think. That's how normal resonance works at least. The bond is always sort of there, but you're not shooting fireballs out of your hand every second. 

Let's give it a shot.

<br /> --- <br /> <br />

See that worked pretty well! You were worried for nothing. Oops, sorry. OK, OK. Carry on.

<br /> --- <br /> <br />

What do you think would happen if we ever looked at each other? Do you think it'd be like two mirrors in front of each other, but in _our minds_?

Woah, no need to yell! I'm literally right here. How am I supposed to warn you before I start talking? That would require talking. Fascinating. Maybe I could try to send a pulse of some kind of emotion? Gasp! We could develop an entire language built entirely from the manipulation of one's emotions. Imagine what society would be like if that's how everyone talked.

Quick, can you feel this? My heart lurches, beating fast. The back of my throat stings. Sorrow, loss. Then it's gone.

You felt it? Nice! I'll use that in the future.

Relax, I won't use that exact feeling. I just wanted to start with something strong to see if it worked. Shifting resonances all the time makes you pretty good at jumping into a new mindset - I should be able to make a pulse that's more subtle.

Hm...? Where was that feeling from? Oh you know, same old story. Nothing interesting. 

I'm standing on a hill. In the valley below, a village burns. Manabu and I are holding hands, our small frames shivering in the cold.

Hey! Stop that. I don't go routing around in your... OK, OK. Point taken. Let's say no more exploring each other's memories without the other's permission? Great.

...

I'm sorry I went digging around in your head before. And I'm sorry I made you drop all the taro you were carrying. Wanna see something cool?

I'm standing on a steep, rocky incline leading up from a small cove. The boat we came in is moored against a stone outcropping several hundred feet below, rocking gently. Beyond the cove, the sea becomes turbulent, the water deep and dark. White crests are blown by the wind. On the horizon, there's a faint outline of the main island of Yosai.

A few chunks of stone skitter past my feet, bouncing down the hillside. I look up. Manabu has reached the top. His long robes, a mix of muted brown and crimson, flap about his lanky form. Even after more than an hour of scrambling up the slope, his robes are immaculate. His long, delicate fingers are unstained by any of the dirt and moss that fills the cracks between rocks. The jagged sword I made earlier is strapped across his back, the gears whirring.

The last 10 feet are nearly straight up, but Manabu doesn't bother looking for handholds. There's a faint _whoomph_ and my hair is blown back by a brief flash of hot air. Manabu floats delicately through the air, rising to the top of the cliff and stepping down onto solid earth again. He turns towards me, extending a hand downwards.

"Care for a lift, brother?" He's smiling. Levitation is a new trick he learned.

I hold up my hands, covered in grime. My trousers are scuffed. There's a tear along one of the knees. "Not much good it'll do me, eh?" I lean forward, planting my hands on the rock and begin to scramble up the last of the slope. 

As I near the top, a hand-sized stone shifts under my foot. My weight shifts suddenly. There's a crackle of sparks all around me as I reach for my new surge. Energy surges through my body, heightening my strength and reflexes. My hand darts forward as I topple backwards, aiming for a large crack in the rock that I can hold on to.

My hand moves faster than I expect, my muscles at least 30% stronger than I'm expecting. This new surge is _strong_. My hand punches through the rock I was aiming for. A cloud of dust and debris hits my face. I continue to fall as my handhold is now non-existent. Whoops.

Before I have a chance to do anything else, my body lurches to a halt. Manabu lifts me slowly through the air. My limbs flail a bit as I try to balance. So embarrassing! How does he stand so gracefully? He must be using extra energy to hold himself upright. I look down the cliffside, wondering if throwing myself down it will be less painful than Manabu's smugness at the top.

Manabu deposits me in front of him, a faint look of concern on his face. "You need to be more careful Hideki. You didn't account for the increased draw from the new surge." There's a flash of heat across my face as Manabu clears the dust and dirt. "You should use--"

"--the second harmonic to modulate intensity." I scratch at my face, getting dirt on my cheeks again. It always itches when he does that cleaning thing. We have superhuman abilities and he finds a way to use it for cleaning? Honestly. "I know, I know! You've only told me 38 times in the last 3 weeks, Man."

"43, I think." 

Would you judge me if I threw my brother off the cliff right now?

No he doesn't have a point! I would have been _fine_. He's always worrying, jumping in before I need his help. If you're going to live in my head, you can't pick his side! 

Besides, he only looks like he has more control because he's wasting energy modulating the bond. He'd be having the same problems as me otherwise.

Oh, right. I keep forgetting you need more context. So, usually the energy you pull from your surge comes in a fixed size? Well, the more powerful your surge, the bigger that fixed size is. Manabu and I both just bonded with larger surges from Amaterasu's domain. But we're still getting used to the strength. We've never had to focus so much energy at once. That's why you see bursts of electricity and heat around us as we're using our powers. As we get better, we'll be able to harness more of the energy that comes across without having to vent some as waste.

Anyways, remember how I said adepts can manipulate their bonds? Well the second harmonic allows for modulating the intensity of the energy that comes across. But using harmonics takes a lot of effort. So right now Manabu is trading off stamina for control. I'd rather just start getting used to the new intensity level.

I turn away from my brother, inspecting the woods around us. Even this close to the cliffside, the trees are huge. Almost 10 feet thick, with trunks at least 100 feet high. Thick, sinewy roots spread from the base, covered in vivid green moss. The forest floor is almost entirely covered. I wonder what kind of trees these are.

What do you mean, Camphor? Camphor what? Oh! The trees are Camphor trees. Hey, watch this.

"Man, look at these Camphor trees. Pretty amazing, right?"

"I didn't realize they were Camphor trees. Have you read of them before?"

"Sorry, I thought you already knew about them. I can lend you some of my books if you'd like?"

That felt _amazing_. Looks like you might not be so useless after all!

A thick fog swirls around the base of the Camphor trees. I take a moment to spin around. Taking in the forest, the cliffside, the churning sea, Yosai's main island in the distance. When you were a kid, did you ever think you'd see something like this?

"Brother! Focus. We need to find the beast and get out of here as quickly as possible. Aratani won't be gone for long."

"Right, sorry!"

We're on a mission from Amaterasu. There's a powerful shifter named Aratani that's been interfering with a lot of the Dawnforge's plans. Manabu found the forest that Aratani is in resonance with and we're here to weaken it.

We actually used to travel with Aratani a while back. But she aligned herself with the Woodheart and we went our separate ways. My brother and I aren't really champions of nature. 

Yeah, she used to be our team member, why? 

No, not really. I mean yeah, we're not _happy_ to be fighting against an old friend. But that's how the Tournament works. There's only one winner at the end. Everyone knows what they're signing up for when they team up. Someday Manabu and I will have to fight too. 

We spend about 20 minutes searching through the woods. Aratani's favored form is a massive snake, so we know there's got to be one of those creatures living in the woods here. If we can find it, we'll have found Aratani's surge.

But like I said, Manabu and I, not big campers. We spend more time in the workshop and the library. We're struggling to find our way through the forest. What do snake tracks even look like?

Look for standing water? How would you know? Um, I think a giant building smashing snake is going to behave a little differently from the little guys slithering around your farm.

We keep searching. As we move in from the windy cliffs, it gets a bit warmer. The ground is softer, more verdant. Everything is damp from fog. I see a faint shimmer between the trees in the distance. It's hard to tell through the fog, but it looks like - maybe a lake reflecting the sun?

...

Standing water, you said?

"Hey! Manabu! I think I read somewhere that snakes like standing water. Maybe we should check near that lake up ahead?"

"Why by the Mother's Scales were you reading about snakes?"

"Oh, you know... I figured we were pursuing a nature-based fighter, so it might be good to research a bit."

Manabu looks surprised for a moment. Eventually he nods approvingly. "That was a strange amount of foresight, brother. Well done."

I swear to the Dawnforge he looks proud right now. He's only 3 seconds older than me! 

Either way, thanks again secret weapon.
