Gasp! It worked! Look at that. These colors! Where is this? A farm? The detail is unbelievable.

And if the resonance is right... Yes! All these memories. Incredible! Ooph, I did _not_ get a happy one. 

And Manabu said it wouldn't work. Well who's laughing now, eh brother? Me! I'm laughing! From now on it's two against one! No more embarrasing--. 

Huh? Wait, stop screaming. Hey! Shut up. Listen.

No seriously, stop freaking out. No, you're not going crazy. I just - cough, cough, splutter - Did you just throw water in your face? I felt it! I'm a GENIUS. The bond is even stronger than I expected. I wonder if I can...

Hey! Slap yourself in the face. 

No? I guess senses are the limit. At least you stopped screaming, though. That part wasn't fun. I'm going to have to figure out some kind of filter for people who startle easily. It's like, what, you've never had a second consciousness spontaneously sprout in your mind? What are you, some kind of farmer? Oh, I guess in this case... 

Hey! Would you mind looking around? I want to see if there are any distinguishing substances I could use to filter out people like you when I try this again.

What's that? You want to know what's going on? Don't worry about it. You're going crazy. Ooooh, I'm a ghoooost. Now pick up that rock and tell me if it tastes like it has a higher than normal zinc concentration or I'll eat your soulllll.

Ugh, this is taking too long. I have things to do! Manabu will be back soon with a location for the beast. I'll just have to figure something out for the filter on my own. Thanks for letting me share your head for a bit! Sorry you're all wet now. And for the screaming. 

Your life seems interesting. Super sad though. Hang in there, man. You keep on farming. Anyways, bye!

...

Phew! Mother's scales that guy was _dull_. Good thing it wasn't permanent like Manabu said it would be. Hah! Manabu, overcautious as always. That's why I'll be the last one standing at the Tournament's end.

I pull the metal band off my head and take a look at the cloudy white void stone inlaid at it's center. The stone is badly cracked. It fades to grey in my hands. Guess it's a single use.

I lay the headband on the heavy wooden table next to me. It's littered with half finished, badly broken, partially exploded metal mechanisms. Manabu won't notice one more amidst the pile.

I should probably put something together for the upcoming mission before Manabu gets back, otherwise he'll wonder what I was up to. I brush back my thick red robe and pull another void stone from my belt. This one flashes blue occasionally. A miniature thunderstorm crackles within the cloudy white depths. Why is it crackling like that?

That's a stupid question. It's holding my new seismic resonance, obviously. I guess it is pretty recent. Still getting used to the upgrade. I focus on the stone, letting my heart rate rise, stoking my impatience. _Frenetic_. The hairs all over my body stand on end for a minute as the harmonics reestablish themselves. The thunderstorm disappears from the stone in my hands.

I stow the void stone and walk to the large furnace across the room. I pull open the thick iron door, one hand blocking the searing heat from my face. A few ingots lay amongst the coals, ready in case the inspiration for something fun strikes me unexpectedly.

Right, time to whip up something quick for the mission. What was the mission again? 

We're hunting down Reiko's source. Sheesh, what's wrong with me? I feel like some of that farmer's dumb rubbed off on me. I need to pull it together before Manabu gets back or he'll suspect something.

Manabu. I keep saying that name. Who is that?

My twin brother! Honestly, how could the effects be this extreme this long after-- oh.

You're still here, aren't you?

Don't just say yes like some kind of idiot! Do you have any idea what this means? Of course you don't. You're a farmer. It means Manabu was RIGHT. Ughhh. He's going to be so frosting _smug_. I can just imagine that stupid, imperious face of his. First he'll be like _I told you the link could be permanent._ Then he'll be all _We don't know how void stones react with sentient resonances. You should have waited until we understood more._ 

Hey! Could you try to be a little less confused? It's seeping over the bond and it feels... weird. Is this how normal people usually feel?

Wait, you're here with _me_! The link can go two ways? That's fascinating. We didn't expect that. Maybe you've got some sort of-- seriously! Knock it off with the panic and the questions! How am I supposed to think?

Fine! If I explain things to you, will you be quiet? Alright, shut up for a minute and let me check your memories to see how much you already know... Gasp. You don't know _anything_. I can't believe this. You were supposed to be my secret weapon.

OK. Where to start. So, you know the Grand Tournament? All those powerful people fighting to be the next Champion? First things first, I'm one of those people. The name's Hideki. My brother and I just got chosen by Amaterasu as her favored warriors. Yeah, chosen by a god. We're kind of a big deal. If you'd ever left your farm you'd probably have heard of us.

Anyways, have you ever wondered where we all get our crazy powers? Ugh. Of course you haven't. Look, I get it OK? You live a hard life with more important things to worry about than the latest tournament gossip. You're so frosting _rustic_. Could you at least _pretend_ like there's a bone of intellectual curiosity in your body?

People have powers. They can do incredible things. That is now relevant to you.

Our abilities come from something called resonance. People with powers, we call them anchors. They draw their power from some source of energy that exists in the world. Imagine a raging river or an area with a lot of seismic activity. We call those sources of power surges. Between the anchor and the surge is a bond. An anchor can pull energy out of their surge, across the bond, and then manifest that energy around them. 

With me so far? Nod if you understand. Hah! See, I _can_ control your body.

OK, so an anchor pulls energy out of a surge, across a bond. To form a bond, you have to be physically near a surge and you also have to share some sort of ideal with it. For a river you could be relentless. Or you might be chaotic like the seismic activity. It doesn't matter what, so long as there's a strong similarity. 

In theory, anyone can form a bond. But it's very physically and mentally taxing. You can't bond with more than one thing at a time. Even a lot of really powerful people can only do it subconsciously. But some people, like my brother and I, are able to exert some concious control over our bonds. We're adepts. Most people can only pull power from their source in a fixed way. But people like my brother and I can alter the energy as it's coming across, warping the effects a bit.

Imagine the string of a guitar. Wait... OK, _phew_. At least you've heard music before. 

So imagine the string of a guitar. Most people, all they can do is pluck a string. Well, no. _Most_ people don't even own a guitar. But ignore them. People who resonate subconsciously, it's like all they can do it pluck a string. They only get one sound. But adepts, we can put our hands on the guitar. We can pinch the string in places to create new notes that have different sounds and feelings to it. 

Hey - this is a pretty good analogy isn't it? I should tell Manabu about it. He'll wanna write it down.

Where was I? Right, adepts can make more notes. At first, we can only use one finger to change the sound. But as an adept gets stronger, they can use more and more fingers to alter the resonance. Ultimately, there are 6 harmonics that we can apply to our bond. There's different ways each harmonic can be used, but each level has a certain quality to it. The first harmonic, for example, is malleability. It lets you bend and shape the energy you manifest. Instead of throwing a big ball of fire, using the first harmonic you could make it into a whip, or shape it to avoid your friends.

The most important harmonic is the third harmonic. Well, it's certainly the most important one for this conversation. But it's my favorite harmonic anyways. The third harmonic is polarity. The bond between surge and anchor has two end points. Usually, those endpoints are the surge and the anchor. But those endpoints also have a sort of directionality to them. And usually, the directionality is from the surge to the anchor.

Without the third harmonic, well, things would be pretty boring. Energy would only flow one way, and when you manifested that energy, it would always have to originate from your body.

What do you mean I'm overexplaining? This is all interesting stuff!

Whatever. With the polarity harmonic, you can do things that alter the poles of a bond. For example, you could reverse the directionality, letting you absorb energy around you and transfer it back to your surge. Or you could flare a pole out of your body temporarily, allowing you to create an effect that doesn't originate from you.

And that's it. Happy? No overexplaining. 

Oh? You don't get how that leads to us living inside each others' heads? Wow. It's like this stuff is complicated and requires a pretty thorough explanation, huh? Jerk.
