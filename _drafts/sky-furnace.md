The fire popped and crackled with a simple-minded abandon. Aki shuffled around the edge of camp on all fours, eyes closed and nose sniffing. Eizo sat on a stump in front of the flames, oiling and sharpening the blade given to him by the tengu. He only sat on half of the stump; Onara had claimed the rest.

It was a happy scene. For crazy people.

Denri huddled as close to the fire as she could, Shiri curled in her lap. No matter how close she got to the fire, her body wouldn't stop shivering. She flinched at the steady _scrrrtch_ of wet stone against steel.

"Do you have to do that every night? It's driving me crazy."

Eizo's hands paused and he looked up. "Probably not. It's mostly a matter of habit. But you never know when it could make the difference." His voice took on the tone of an old mantra. "Dull blade, dead Blade." He chuckled to himself.

"Well it's putting my nerves on edge. It sounds... predatory."

"I can stop if you want me to, but I would prefer to be prepared. Perhaps you could do something to take your mind off of it. Have you tried training?"

Denri held her hands up and a feeble stutter of sparks flashed across her fingers. "Can't focus."

There was a crash of leaves behind them and Denri's head shot around fast enough that her neck cramped momentarily.

"No fair!" Aki had fallen face first into a low bush. She squirmed and struggled until she was on her back, breathing hard from the exertion. Her arms and face were covered in faint scratches from the bramble.

__You said to make it a challenge, mistress.__ Hattori sat perched along a branch above Aki's new prison. He dropped down to help pull her free. __You did manage to find my general location.__

"I wasn't expecting you to go up! It's hard enough just figuring out direction using smell." It was strange to watch a teenager pouting like a small child. "I don't want to play anymore today."

Aki shook her head. In Denri's lap Shiri did the same, opening his eyes and stretching. Aki gave him a pet on the head as she dropped down by the fire. "Thanks for the help, Shiri."

Hattori stood by the edge of the woods, looking uncertain. Maybe. Denri still couldn't really tell. __I am sorry mistress, I will try to do better next time.__

Eizo gave Aki a stern look. She looked back stubbornly for a moment, chin thrust out. Eventually she wilted. Aki waved a hand to Hattori. "It's OK. I'm sorry I lost my temper." She patted the ground beside her. "You should come sit by the fire." Hattori nodded and joined.

Denri let out a sigh and tried to lose herself in the flames again. It had been a week since they left the tengu village. A week pressing on through the foggy, overgrown wilderness that stretched across most of Yosai.

Every day that passed, Aki got a little better at sensing nearby monsters. There had been a couple close calls. One outright fight with a one-tailed kitsune. But on the whole they had avoided the worst of the dangers. After the first couple days, the others had found a rhythm. Denri had not.

Spending a month in the tengu village had helped some. When they fought the kitsune, Denri kept her head enough to do her part. But she couldn't calm down like the others. Every unexpected sound made her flinch. And the constant nerves suppressed her powers.

Eizo watched her across the fire. "There is a mental exercise we learned as Blades to help us cope with fear. It involves deconstructing the thing you are scared of into smaller and smaller parts until it ceases to be something you fear."

"How is that supposed to work?"

"When you fear something, you ascribe more power to it than it actually has. Breaking it down helps you remember that, fundamentally, it's not made of anything special.

"You fear the monsters in the wilderness. As 'monsters', they are something that inspires terror. But these monsters are nothing more than a head, a torso, and limbs. And those are nothing more than skin, flesh, blood, mucus, and bone."

Denri made a face. "Ew."

Aki looked up from the fire. "Do you feel any better?"

"No, now I'm just imagining a big goopy ball of flesh and blood coming to crush me... I'll get over it eventually. It's just taking a bit of time.

"Let's talk about something else to take my mind off of it. What's our plan once we make it to the water? How are we going to get to Kazora?"

Eizo finished oiling his blade and sheathed it. Onara immediately jumped into his lap. Eizo was still as stone while she spun and kneaded his legs. When she laid down and closed her eyes again, he sighed in relief. He began to pet her carefully while he spoke.

"The twins do business with nearly every major town in Yosai, providing their weapons and inventions in exchange for raw materials. They transport the technology themselves, but the raw materials come in through a port at the base of the Sky Furnace.

"That port is chaotic at the best of times. If we can get passage on a ship heading that way, it shouldn't be hard to sneak in."

Denri brightened. "A bit of time at sea sounds great to me."

Aki frowned. "Why do we have to keep hiding? Why can't we just tell everyone we're in the Tournament and then nobody can mess with us?"

Eizo shook his head. "There's more to it than that. Right now none of us have bounties. We're unranked. Our first challenge is going to determine a lot about our chances of winning."

Denri nodded, but Aki looked completely lost. "Kid, how much do you actually know about how the Tournament works?"

"I know enough! You fight and get strong and then the strongest have a big battle to decide who's the winner."

"Well... I mean yeah, in broad strokes..."

"But perhaps a more thorough understanding would be helpful. The 'big battle' you referenced is the True Combat. Every 50 years, the 12 highest ranked Heroes - the Sanyaku - come together for a final confrontation to determine who wins the Tournament.

"In general, our goal is more or less what you said, Aki. At least one of us must make it into the Sanyaku and win the True Combat. But the True Combat is only three years away. We don't have a lot of time to climb through the ranks."

"Yeah! So we need to start fighting!"

"Not necessarily."

Aki groaned. "Why not?"

"Your ranking in the tournament is determined by how high your bounty is. Your bounty is set by those who oversee the Tournament and there are only two ways it can go up.

"The most common way is to complete quests submitted by ordinary people. Someone comes to the tournament officials with a task and some reward for completing it. The officials rank the difficulty, then make it available to Heroes.

"But most of these quests are low-ranked. And the rare high-ranking quest usually goes to stronger competitors with higher bounties. Increasing your ranking through quests is a slow process.

"The other way to increase your ranking is through challenges from Kami."

"What are Kami?"

"Kami are anyone, or anything, directly affiliated with the gods. That includes the gods themselves, all the past Tournament Champions, and the monsters created by the gods.

"If a Kami wants to interfere with a Hero in the Tournament, they have to offer a challenge of a difficulty similar to the Hero's bounty. Which also goes slowly."

Aki pulled up a patch of moss in frustration. "That's not fair! Every way is slow then."

Eizo nodded wearily. "The Tournament was designed to _control_ the growth of the Five Races, not foster it. But there is one moment where we have some agency.

"While we're unranked, we get to choose the terms of our first challenge. We can pick something that would set our starting bounty much higher.

"That's why we should wait as long as we can. Right now the two of you are getting stronger much faster than we could incrementally raise our bounties. Until that changes, we should try to stay unranked."

Aki was still looking at the ground, digging in the dirt sulkily. "It's still annoying. I'm tired of hiding and running away!"

Eizo sighed. "Believe me, we're going to have plenty of excitement soon enough. Once people know what the two of you can do, things will never be quiet again."

<br />

<br />

Three days later they stepped out of the trees and Denri released her two-week-long held breath.

They stood at the top of a hillside sloping gently toward the coast a mile away. Well-manicured terraces walked like giant steps towards a modest village huddled by the sea.

She couldn't hear it yet, but the sight and smell of salt water filled Denri with an energy she hadn't felt in years. Nothing felt like home to a flit more than a good boat with a solid wind cutting across the open ocean.

Before the others could react, Denri let out a whoop and started bounding towards the village.

Aki squealed. "It's a race! Come on Hattori!" The crow tengu jumped into the air and flew lazy circles overhead.

__It is nice to spread my wings again.__

Eizo called out behind them to be careful, and was thoroughly ignored.

A few terraces down, a trail began that lead to the village. Standing ankle-deep in one of the rice paddies by the trail was a short, sturdy woman plainly dressed. She stood with her hands at the small of her back, unconcerned as she watched Hattori circle through the air. When she saw Denri approaching she raised a hand and smiled.

"Welcome, stranger."

The woman exuded a simple warmth that pulled a smile to Denri's face. She walked up to the woman. "Hello!"

The woman nodded to Hattori in the air. "Is that one with you lot, or should I be worried?"

"Hmm? Oh, yeah!" Having a monster flying overhead was probably not the best way to approach a new town. The woman seemed to be taking it well enough, though. "He's nothing to worry about. Hattori!" Denri gestured at the ground aggressively and he approached.

"You must be part of Ninigi's lot then. I've never known one of the crow tengu to have a name before. Or white feathers for that matter..."

The woman didn't look suspicious or accusatory. But there was something about her expression that made Denri feel like a child caught with her hand in the cookie jar as a parent walks in.

"Oh! Um, yeah he was born weird." Denri looked over her shoulder desperately, the others were still catching up. "We're not allied with Ninigi, though."

Denri realized she had no idea what this woman or this town's affiliation might be. "Not that I'm trying to say we don't like him or anything! That's just not why Hattori's with us. We... saved him from the rest of his flock. They attacked him. Because he was born so weird. I'm sorry if he scared you. We'll make sure he doesn't go flying overhead anymore."

The woman held up a hand, chuckling. "No need to worry, friend. I was just curious, is all." She nodded to Hattori as he landed. "Where do you hail from?"

"Terminus!" Denri blurted the answer without thinking, then nearly clamped her hand over her mouth. The woman seemed so honest. And they had been in the wilderness so long. She was desperate to trust someone again.

Eizo and Aki caught up at last and the woman nodded. "Greetings. Your friend tells me you all made your way here from Terminus."

Eizo frowned and looked towards Denri, but she was preemptively looking to the ground in shame. "Yes."

"Awfully far from home. You lot must be Heroes to make it over the mountains in one piece. What's your bounties?"

"We're not Heroes. We hired a party to take us this far, but they weren't interested in coming into town so we parted ways yesterday."

The woman's head tilted sideways a fraction, looking at Eizo with curiosity.

"Hey!" Aki pointed a finger at her. "She's doing something in our heads. I can feel it!"

Eizo looked back to the woman and placed a hand on the hilt of his sword.

The woman held up her hands. "Whoa, whoa! Alright, you caught me. Sorry to pry a bit, but you can never be too careful when strangers come spilling out of the woods. I'm just trying to use what little bit of power I have to look out for my village. No harm meant."

Eizo didn't take his hand off his sword.

"We're all being careful, yeah? You lot aren't just hapless travelers. Not coming as far as you did. With a tengu tagging along to boot. And one of you is a soul resonant like me." She looked at Aki. "I'm going to guess the rest of you have powers too. So why don't we start again? My name's Kiyoshi." She held out her hand.

Eizo looked at it for a moment, then shook. "Eizo." The rest of the group introduced themselves as well.

Aki looked confused as she shook the woman's hand. "What's a soul resonant?"

Kiyoshi smiled. "There's two kinds of resonant bonds people can form. Elemental resonants bond with a source of natural energy that they draw from like a well. Soul resonants bond with living things and transfer properties between them."

"Oh! Like how I can copy Shiri's smelling!"

"Yup. Soul resonances can go both ways, so in this case I was sharing a bit of trust in the hope of encouraging honesty."

Aki looked at Eizo. "How come you didn't tell me what it's called?"

"Labels are far less important than the skills that will help keep you alive."

Kiyoshi looked at Eizo. "You're her teacher? That explains why I couldn't influence you. It seemed like you had some mental training."

Denri patted Aki's shoulder. "Don't worry kid, Eizo didn't tell me squat either. I didn't even know the difference between an internal and external resonance until way after it was relevant."

Kiyoshi laughed. "This one on the other hand. Like leading a pup with a strip of meat." She winked at Aki. "Which element is your resonance?"

Denri clamped a hand over her mouth and glared at the woman.

Aki laughed and poked Denri in the side. "She got you! So can you turn into animals too?"

Kiyoshi shook her head. "Sadly, no. I'm a mind resonant, not body. It's like how your friend here can only do internal or external. Only sparks can do both."

"Oh, right."

Kiyoshi looked sideways at Eizo. "I don't want to interfere with your training or anything, but if you folks were planning on staying in town for a while I wouldn't mind showing Aki a few tricks and training exercises."

"Really?" Aki looked to Eizo with excitement.

"That's a very generous offer, but unfortunately we'll have to decline. We have relatively urgent business in Kazora and were hoping to find passage on a ship as soon as possible." Aki's shoulders slumped.

"No worry, just thought I'd offer." Kiyoshi clapped her hands together. "Well, I've kept you all standing around long enough. You seem like good people, so don't let me keep you any longer. There's a few ships in port that run routes to the Sky Furnace, I imagine one of them has room for a few passengers."

The group said their goodbyes and started along the trail toward the town. They made it a few steps before they realized Hattori was still standing in place.

__Perhaps you could train me?__

Eizo turned sharply towards Hattori, but Kiyoshi seemed unsurprised. "I was wondering if you were going to say anything."

__You knew?__

She nodded. "I didn't want to pry any more than I needed to get a sense of your intentions. But I could feel your awareness brushing up against mine throughout the conversation."

__I'm sorry. I didn't realize.__

"No need for apologies. It takes a fair bit of training to direct and mask your attention enough that other mind resonants can't feel it. To be honest, I was surprised by how well Aki concealed herself for someone so inexperienced."

Eizo looked at Kiyoshi with narrowed eyes. "You do not seem surprised by Hattori's abilities."

She shrugged. "It's weird for a tengu, sure. But there are plenty of monsters the gods made with soul resonance. Maybe Ninigi's tinkering a bit. So long as I don't sense any ill will, I don't mind if he's different."

Aki walked back to Hattori. "She can't train you, Eizo just said we have to keep going."

__I was thinking I could stay, if Kiyoshi is willing.__

Aki looked hurt. "You don't want to stay with us? Is it because I got mad at your for hiding in the tree?"

__I do want to stay with you, mistress.__ Hattori looked down at his hands. __But I want to get stronger like you and Denri. I want to understand what I am becoming.__

Aki shook her head, tears spilling down her cheeks. "That's dumb! You're _becoming_ part of our family. I'm sorry I haven't been helping you practice too. Next time we play I can hide and you can look for me."

Hattori shook his head. __Eizo says we can't draw attention to ourselves yet. People will notice my presence if I go into town. But I can rejoin you when you return. It won't be that long. And perhaps I will learn something to teach you as well.__ Hattori turned back to Kiyoshi. __Would you accept me as a student for a time?__

"Sure, I figure if I could spare time for the girl I could spare time for you just as well. You're gonna have to help around the fields though."

Hattori bowed deeply to Kiyoshi. __Yes, I am happy to help with your daily work. Thank you.__

"No need to thank. It'll be interesting." Kiyoshi chuckled. "Who's ever heard of a tengu helping around the house?"

Hattori turned back to the group. __I will wait here while you all explore Sky Furnace. If you cannot return to this town directly, Aki should be able to let me know.__

Aki looked at Hattori, her expression fragile. "You promise you're not trying to leave us?"

Hattori pressed his forehead against hers. __I promise.__ She nodded weakly.

Eizo took a step forward and held out his hand. "If all goes well, you won't have much time. Train hard." As Hattori shook, Eizo held his gaze for a moment. "And stay guarded." The tengu nodded.

Aki elbowed Denri in the side, nudging her towards the tengu.

"I, uh... I'll see you around."

__When you return, I hope to be a better match in our training sessions.__

Denri nodded. "I'm still going to hit you in the face, but it would be nice if it was a more interesting challenge."

"Denri!"

"What! We're being manly. He gets it." Denri turned back to Hattori and shook his hand. "Good luck."

<br />

<br />
<br />

Denri stood at the bow of the boat, grinning as the salt spray splashed against her face. Her stomach lurched pleasingly with the rise and fall of the waves. She thought of her parents and smiled.

The ship had no sail, yet somehow it cut forward through the water. Not as fast as the sailboat Denri grew up on, but still at a reasonable pace. Traveling _against_ the wind still felt unusual to Denri.

Weirder still was the design of the boat itself. Gone were the sleek, wooden lines she had known. Thin and light like a needle for cutting through the waves. The vessel they hitched a ride on was chunky, with metal plating and a lot of noisy moving parts.

They didn't have any coin, so working for passage was their only option. And the only reason the captain accepted the offer was because Denri was a flit with experience at sea. As much as she wanted to spend the entire day leaning over the railing staring at the water, Denri had the most weight to pull to earn their keep. She sighed and hopped down from the ledge.

Her work was mostly odd jobs, filling gaps in the regular crew. She spent some time helping redistribute the cargo, moving heavy items just acquired down into the lower hold while bringing forward the raw materials to be offloaded at Sky Furnace. When that was done, she helped another crew mate retie some of the riggings that had gone astray in a storm a few days ago.

As was common for most sailing crews, nearly everyone was a flit. It was jarring at first. She'd spent so long bouncing around Terminus, dodging knees and careless hands. Unable to see where she was going unless she paused to climb up a street post.

Here, everything was sized for her. Everyone shared the same sun-darkened skin. Every ship had it's own way of speaking, but they always followed the same utilitarian logic: clear and concise. You didn't have time for shades of grey in the middle of a storm. After a couple hours, Denri had picked up the vernacular, walking wide-stanced and joking with the rest of the crew.

Eizo was doing his best to fit in, though his tall frame was especially conspicuous. Denri had lost count of how many times she had seen him thunk his head when trying to duck under something. It _almost_ wasn't funny anymore. To avoid further head injury, he stuck to one place, shoveling black rocks into a furnace that somehow powered the ship.

Aki had proven so immediately useless, and seasick, that the captain excused her from duty. She hung over the railing at the stern, alternating between petting the cats and puking her guts out. The town had long ago faded from sight, but occasionally she looked into the distance morosely.

Denri gave one final tug against some netting that she was retying on the side of the boat, then pulled herself back over the railing. As she landed on the deck, she saw the captain walking by and got her attention.

"Yes?"

The captain was a flit woman a bit taller than Denri. Her dark skin was leathery, with a web of weather-worn wrinkles around her eyes and mouth. Her black, frizzy hair erupted from beneath a cap. Denri knew her own hair would look the same once the continual wind and salty spray had their way.

The woman was dressed eclectically. A heavy body-length coat, frequently patched, hung over a gaudy, billowing shirt and tight trousers. It was a throwback to the days when flits spent more time pirating than transporting goods for the Five Races.

Despite the interesting garb, Captain Hama was plain in her communication. As the one who handled negotiations with clients at port, she was also the only crew member who didn't speak in much of a vernacular.

"I was curious about the ship. My family bounced a pretty small route when I was young, but stil, I never saw anything like it."

"South coast?"

"Aye, south east. Mostly along Stormcatcher Bay."

The captain whistled. "Tough bounce, that one." Denri felt a moment of pride. "I imagine you wouldn't have seen any hot-irons in an area that angry. These girls are clunky, can't follow the storms as well since we're not catching the wind."

"That part confuses me. How do the hot-irons move? I see my friend shoveling rocks into a fire and they said somehow that's doing it."

"I don't much understand it myself. I figure nobody really does except the Twins and all the bookworms they've got floating around them. But the basic principle is simple enough. We keep a fire going under a big pot of water. That water turns to steam, which spins a wheel under the ship. The wheel pushes us forward. When that stops working, we go back to Sky Furnace and they get it going again."

"Sky Furnace builds the hot-irons?"

The captain nodded. "Sailboats couldn't carry the heavy loads they wanted. And the wind was too unreliable for their tastes. So they did what they always do, built something to do it better.

"For a while now they've been giving a hot-iron to any crew willing to bounce a certain number of supply runs to the Sky Furnace each year. It's a pretty good deal."

"You must've been to Kazora a lot then?"

"Going on 10 years now, yeah."

"What's it like?"

The captain laughed. "I don't wanna ruin the spectacle if you're going in fresh. Trust me, the surprise is worth it. There's nothing quite like Sky Furnace. I can say that you'll need to buy masks, though.

"What do you mean?"

"Everyone wears masks in Sky Furnace. Don't worry, they sell them in port for people who want to enter the city."

That was convenient for them to stay hidden. "Why do they wear masks?"

"It's supposed to keep everyone logical. No distractions or emotion. They bring in bookworms from all over Yosai with all kinds of different ideas. They've gotta be pretty careful to avoid conflict."

Denri tried to imagine a completely logical society. All she saw was a bunch of Eizos walking around stiffly, nodding to each other in passing. She shivered. "That sounds horrible."

The captain shrugged and spit over the railing. "Can't argue with the results. Sky Furnace is one of the most powerful cities in Yosai. I'm not sure I could live with the costs either, though."

<br />

<br />
<br />

The voyage was a relatively short one. Kazora was on Seki, the desolate, volcanic island northwest of Yosai. The town they had departed from was more or less directly across the strait that separated Seki from the mainland. It was only four days before Sky Furnace came into view on the horizon. Denri was glad the captain didn't spoil the surprise.

At first, Denri didn't know what they were looking at. A mountain loomed on the horizon, obscured through haze. The summit was strangely lopsided.

A little closer, and the mountain began to glow. A billowing cloud poured from the top. It was a volcano.

Denri hadn't seen many volcanoes in her life, but they had spotted a few in the distance as they crossed the mountains. Denri was pretty sure their summits weren't supposed to look like what she was seeing now.

A bit closer and Denri realized the summit was moving. Swaying ever so slightly with an unseen breeze. She asked the captain about it.

Captain Hama laughed again. "You'll see soon enough."

Eventually they were close enough that the volcano dominated the horizon. Denri had to crane her head backwards to see the summit.

Kazora was a massive, very active, volcano. Lava ran down its sides in lazy rivers, casting a dull red under-glow to the surroundings. At the base of the mountain shielded from the lava runs by a high metal wall, was the port. Overflowing with hot-irons, even from a distance the chaos of loading and unloading cargo could be heard. The port filled a crescent bay edge to edge, and Denri couldn't see a single dock that was empty.

At the back of the port was a thick metal cable. Following it up through the ash and haze, the summit finally clicked into place. Denri gasped.

The Sky Furnace wasn't _on_ the volcano. It was above it. Giant, oblong balloons floated in the air over the summit. There were hundreds, maybe thousands, of the balloons tethered in small groups like clusters of grapes. Some were connected by narrow bridges. Others had large, flat platforms built over many balloons.

On top of the balloons were buildings and parks. One even had a fountain spraying water over the edges with a basin underneath to catch the flow. It had all the pieces of a city, just thousands of feet in the air.

As she watched, Denri saw a handful of balloons around the edges in the process of attaching or detaching to the cities.

"Whaaaa...?" Denri turned to see Aki standing beside her, slack jawed. The girls arm was half raised, like she had intended to point but lost the train of thought halfway through.

Eizo walked up behind them, looking upward stoically. "Quite the sight, isn't it?"

"'Quite the sight'? _'Quite the sight'?_ It's a fairy tale in real life! Look at this place!"

"Yes, it makes a strong impression."

Denri shook her head as she looked back to the sky. "Unbelievable. Does anything get a reaction out of you?"

The captain returned to the deck after delivering orders to her crew. "We'll wait here for a dock to open up. Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. Our turnaround is going to be fairly quick and it sounded like you all had business skyward so we won't be able to wait around. I can give you the names of some good captains, if you'd like."

Eizo nodded to the woman. "Yes, if you wouldn't mind."

<br />
---
<br />
<br />

Eizo was right about the chaos. Crews were running around barking orders so loud it was hard for Denri to hear her own thoughts. If the docks hadn't been mostly full of flits, she probably would have been trampled.

They managed to haggle a set of masks off a kid sitting on a crate near edge of the docks. Aki was disappointed that they all depicted a stylized dragon with a blank expression. There was some selection of colors.

The only way off the docks and up to the city was a large cable at the back of the port. A large, metal and glass sphere lumbered up and down the cable. Their group was shoved unceremoniously into the transport when it was their turn.

Denri squirmed her way through the crowd of passengers and pressed her face against the glass for one last look at the port. She smiled at the frenetic energy of the sailors crawling below.

The trip had been too short, but Denri made a resolution to herself. Somehow, before this adventure was over, she was going to get a boat again.

--Dragon appears briefly--
