The fire popped and crackled with a simple-minded abandon. Aki shuffled around the edge of camp, eyes closed and nose sniffing. Eizo sat on a stump in front of the flames, oiling and sharpening a blade given to him by the tengu. Onara had claimed half his seat.

It was a happy scene. For crazy people.

Denri huddled as close to the fire as she could, Shiri curled in her lap. No matter how close she got to the fire, she couldn't quite stop shivering. She flinched at the steady _scrrrtch_ of Eizo's whetstone against steel.

"Do you have to do that every night? It's driving me crazy."

Eizo's hands paused and he looked up. "Probably not. It's mostly a matter of habit. But you never know when it could make the difference." His voice took on the tone of an old mantra. "Dull blade, dead Blade." He chuckled to himself.

"Well it's putting my nerves on edge. It sounds... predatory."

"Perhaps you could do something to take your mind off of it. Have you tried training?"

Denri held her hands up and a feeble stutter of sparks flashed across her fingers. "Can't focus."

"Still?"

A crash of leaves behind them pulled Denri's head around fast enough to cramp her neck.

"No fair!" Aki had fallen face first into a low bush. She squirmed and struggled until she was on her back, breathing hard from the exertion. Her arms and face were covered in scratches from the bramble.

__You said to make it a challenge, mistress.__ Hattori perched on a branch above Aki's shrub prison. He dropped down to pull her free. __You did very well to find my general location.__

"I wasn't expecting you to go up! It's hard enough figuring out direction with my nose." It was strange to watch a teenager pouting like a small child. "I don't want to play anymore today."

Aki shook her head like she was clearing away cobwebs. In Denri's lap, Shiri did the same, opening his eyes and stretching. Aki gave him a pet on the head as she dropped down by the fire. "Thanks for the help, Shiri."

Hattori stood by the edge of camp, looking uncertain. Maybe. Denri still couldn't really tell.

__I am sorry mistress, I will be more careful next time.__

Eizo gave Aki a stern look. She stared back stubbornly for a moment, chin thrust out. Eventually she wilted and waved a hand to Hattori. "It's OK. I'm sorry I lost my temper." She patted the ground beside her. "You should come sit by the fire." Hattori nodded and joined.

Denri puffed her cheeks and let out a long sigh through pursed lips. She tried to lose herself in the flames again. It had been a week since they left the tengu village. A week pressing on through the foggy, overgrown wilderness that stretched across most of Yosai.

There had been a couple close calls. One outright fight with a one-tailed kitsune. But on the whole they had avoided the worst of the dangers. Aki's mysterious connection to monsters was getting stronger. Every day she could sense them further away.

Relatively speaking, they were having an uneventful journey. And after the first few days without incident, the others had found a rhythm. Denri had not.

Spending a month in the tengu village had helped. When they fought the kitsune, she kept her head enough to fight. But she couldn't relax during the in-between moments like the others. The constant nerves suppressed her powers.

She hated the fear. Life in Terminus hadn't been easy, but she liked who she had become there. The old fears dredged up by monsters made her feel like that bold, trusting girl had never really existed. Just a mask worn by a broken girl who failed her family when they needed her most.

A mask worn so long she fooled herself into thinking it was real.

Denri smacked her cheeks, blinking against the sting. Right now she was brave or she wasn't. No point tying herself up in knots worrying about it. She knew where she wanted to aim for the future and that's all that mattered.

Eizo watched her across the fire. "There is a mental exercise we learned as Blades to help cope with fear. Would you like to hear it?"

Denri looked at Eizo with her hands still on her cheeks, stretching her face down as she responded. "I'll try anything at this point."

"The key is to deconstruct the thing you are scared of into smaller and smaller parts until it ceases to be something you fear."

"Huh?"

"When you fear something, you ascribe more power to it than it actually has. Breaking it down helps you remember that, fundamentally, it's just as mundane as we are.

"You fear the monsters in the wilderness. Labeled as 'monsters', they are something that inspires terror. But they are also just a head, a torso, and limbs. And those are nothing more than skin, flesh, blood, mucus, and bone. No different than you or I."

Denri made a face. "Ew."

Aki looked up from the fire. "Do you feel any better?"

"No, now I'm just imagining a big goopy ball of flesh and blood coming to crush me..." She let out another long sigh. This was pointless. "I'll get over it eventually. It's just taking a bit of time.

"Let's talk about something else to take my mind off of it. What's our plan once we make it to the water? How are we getting to Kazora?"

Eizo finished oiling his blade and sheathed it. Onara immediately jumped into his lap. He was still as stone while she spun and kneaded his legs. When the cat laid down and closed her eyes again, Eizo sighed in relief. He began to pet her carefully while he spoke.

"The Twins do business with every major town in Yosai, selling weapons and technology in exchange for raw materials. The payments of raw materials come in through a port at the base of the Sky Furnace.

"That port is chaotic at the best of times. If we can get passage on a ship heading that way, it shouldn't be hard to slip into the city without drawing attention."

Denri brightened. "A bit of time at sea sounds great to me."

Aki frowned. "Why do we have to be unnoticed? Why can't we just tell everyone we're in the Tournament and then nobody can mess with us?"

Eizo shook his head. "There's more to it than that. Right now none of us have bounties. Our first challenge is going to determine a lot about our chances of winning."

Denri nodded, but Aki looked completely lost. "Kid, how much do you actually know about how the Tournament works?"

"I know enough! You fight and get strong and then the strongest have a big battle to decide who's the winner."

"Well... I mean yeah, in broad strokes..."

"But perhaps a more thorough understanding would be helpful. The 'big battle' you referenced is officially known as the True Combat. Every 50 years, the 12 highest ranked Heroes - the Sanyaku - come together for a final confrontation to determine who wins the Tournament.

"Our goal is more or less what you said, Aki. One of us must earn a high enough bounty to join the Sanyaku and win the True Combat three years from now. But three years is not a lot of time."

"Yeah! So we need to start fighting!"

"Not necessarily."

Aki groaned. "Why not?"

"The bounty that determines your ranking is set by those who run the Tournament and there are only two ways it can go up.

"The most common way is to complete quests submitted by ordinary people. Someone comes to the Tournament officials with a task and a reward for completing it. The officials rank the difficulty, then make it available to Heroes.

"But most of these quests are low-ranked. Ordinary people have ordinary problems. And the rare high-ranking quest usually goes to stronger competitors with higher bounties. Increasing your ranking through quests is a slow process.

"The other way to increase your ranking is by challenging Kami."

"What are Kami?"

"Kami are anyone, or anything, directly affiliated with the gods. That includes the gods themselves, all the past Tournament Champions, and the monsters created by the gods.

"If a Kami wants to attack a Hero in the Tournament, they must first offer a challenge at the level of the Hero's bounty. Which means completing these challenges _also_ increases your bounty slowly."

Aki pulled up a patch of moss in frustration. "That's not fair! Every way is slow then."

Eizo nodded wearily. "Now you see our problem. The Tournament was designed to _control_ the growth of the Five Races, not foster it. But there is one moment where we will have some agency.

"While we're unranked, we get to choose the difficulty of our first challenge. Which means we can pick something that would set our starting bounty much higher.

"Right now the two of you are getting stronger much faster than bounties typically grow. Until that changes, we should try to stay unranked."

Aki was still looking at the ground, digging in the dirt sulkily. "It's still annoying. I'm tired of hiding and running away!"

Eizo sighed. "Believe me, we're going to have plenty of excitement soon enough. Once people know what the two of you can do, things will never be quiet again."

<br />

<br />
<br />

Three days later they stepped out of the trees and Denri released her two-week-long held breath.

They stood atop a hillside sloping gently toward the coast a mile away. Well-manicured terraces walked like giant steps toward a modest village huddled by the sea.

She couldn't hear it yet, but the sight and smell of the ocean filled Denri with an energy she hadn't felt in years. Nothing felt like home to a flit more than a good boat with a solid wind at your back.

Before the others could react, Denri let out a whoop and started bounding towards the village.

Aki squealed. "It's a race! Come on Hattori!" The crow tengu jumped into the air and flew lazy circles overhead.

__It is nice to spread my wings again.__

Eizo called out behind them to be careful. He was completely ignored.

A few terraces down, a trail began. Standing ankle-deep in one of the rice paddies by the path was a short, sturdy woman plainly dressed. She stood with her hands at the small of her back, unconcerned as she watched Hattori circle through the air. She raised a hand and smiled at Denri.

"Welcome, stranger."

The woman exuded a simple warmth that pulled a smile to Denri's face as well. She walked up to the woman. "Hi!"

The woman nodded to Hattori in the air. "Is that one with you lot, or should I be worried?"

"Hmm? Oh, yeah!" Having a monster flying overhead was probably not the best way to approach a new town. The woman seemed to be taking it well enough, though.

"He's nothing to worry about. Hattori!" Denri gestured at the ground aggressively.

"You must be part of Ninigi's lot then. I've never known one of the crow tengu to have a name before. Or white feathers for that matter..."

The woman didn't look suspicious. But somehow Denri still felt like a child caught with her hand in the cookie jar.

"Oh! Um, yeah he was born weird." Denri looked over her shoulder desperately. The others were still catching up. "We're not allied with Ninigi, though."

She realized she had no idea what this woman or this town's affiliation might be. "Not that we don't like him or anything! That's just not why Hattori's with us. We... saved him from the rest of his flock. They attacked him. Because he was born so weird. I'm sorry if he scared you. We'll make sure he doesn't go flying overhead anymore."

The woman held up a hand, chuckling. "No need to worry, friend. I was just curious, is all." She nodded to Hattori as he landed. "Where do you hail from?"

"Terminus!" Denri blurted the answer without thinking, then nearly clamped her hand over her mouth. The woman seemed so honest. And they had been in the wilderness so long. Denri was desperate to trust someone again.

Eizo and Aki caught up at last and the woman nodded. "Greetings. Your friend tells me you all made your way here from Terminus."

Eizo frowned and looked toward Denri, but she was preemptively staring at the ground in shame. He nodded reluctantly. "That's true."

"Awful far from home. You lot must be Heroes to make it over the mountains in one piece. What's your bounties?"

"We're not Heroes. We hired a party to take us this far, but they weren't interested in coming into town so we parted ways yesterday."

The woman's head tilted sideways a fraction, looking at Eizo with curiosity.

"Hey!" Aki pointed a finger at her. "She's doing something in our heads. I can feel it!"

Eizo looked back to the woman and placed a hand on the hilt of his sword.

The woman held up her hands. "Whoa, whoa! Alright, you caught me. Sorry to pry, but you can never be too careful when strangers come spilling out of the woods. I'm just keeping an eye out on behalf of my village. Can't fault someone for that."

Eizo didn't take his hand off his sword. The woman did not look particularly concerned.

"We're all being careful, yeah? You lot aren't just hapless travelers. Not coming as far as you did. With a tengu tagging along to boot."

She looked at Aki. "And one of you is a soul resonant like me. I'm going to guess the rest of you have powers too. So why don't we start again? People call me Ki." She held out her hand.

Eizo looked at it for a moment, then shook. "Eizo." The rest of the group introduced themselves as well.

Aki looked confused as she shook the woman's hand. "What's a soul resonant?"

Ki smiled. "I'm surprised you don't know, if you could sense what I was doing earlier. There's two kinds of resonant bonds people can form. Elemental resonants bond with a source of natural energy and draw from it like a well. Soul resonants bond with living things and transfer properties between them."

"Oh! Like how I can use Shiri's smelling!"

"That's right. Soul resonances can go both ways, so in this case I was sharing a bit of my trust in the hope of encouraging honesty."

Aki looked at Eizo. "How come you didn't tell me I was a soul resonant?"

"Labels are far less important than the skills that will help keep you alive."

Ki looked at Eizo and nodded as though a suspicion had been confirmed. "You're her teacher? I thought it felt like you had some mental training."

Denri patted Aki's shoulder. "Don't worry kid, Eizo didn't tell me squat either. I didn't know the difference between an internal and external resonance until way after it was relevant."

Ki laughed. "This one on the other hand. Like leading a pup with a strip of meat." She winked at Aki. "Which element is your resonance?"

This time Denri actually did clamp her hand over her mouth. She glared at the woman.

Aki laughed and poked Denri in the side. "She got you! So can you turn into animals too?"

Ki shook her head. "Sadly, no. I'm a mind resonant, not body. It's like how your friend here can only do internal or external. Only sparks have both types of soul resonance, just like only adepts can use internal and external."

"Oh, right." Aki had the sense not to say any more.

Ki looked sideways at Eizo. "I don't want to interfere with your training, but if you folks were planning on staying a while, I wouldn't mind showing Aki a few training exercises. I'm curious to see what the girl can do. You can stay here with me."

"Really?" Aki looked to Eizo with excitement.

"That's a very generous offer, but unfortunately we'll have to decline. We were hoping to find passage on a ship as soon as possible." Aki's shoulders slumped.

<KIYOSHI BECOMES MORE STERN. REVEALS WHO SHE IS AND SAYS "CAN'T JUST LET A BUNCH OF UNKNOWNS LIKE YOU ENTER MY TOWN" LET'S FIGHT>

Ki's face took on a slight frown, looking more stern. "Well, see, that leaves me with a bit of a problem."

Eizo's hand returned to his sword, sensing the sudden shift in Ki's tone. "What problem is that?"

"Well, you lot are clearly lying. You say you aren't Heroes, but you made your way across half the continent and you've got at least two resonants in your party. Not to mention whatever training it is writ all over you and the way you move.

"You all seem like nice folks. I don't mind one bit sharing some knowledge and helping you out, in exchange for letting me get a sense for what you can do. But you want to make a straight shot into my town, with who knows what kind of powers and what kind of motivations. So, one more time, do you want to tell me a bit more about yourselves? Or let me test your strength?"

Denri felt a pit of fear form in her stomach. It seemed as though Ki suddenly loomed much taller. Only Eizo seemed able to hold his ground, though his hand tightened on his blade. He spoke carefully.

"I assure you, we are not Heroes and we mean your town no harm. If you are truly worried about our intentions, you are welcome to alert the authorities and they can watch as we do nothing but charter a ship and leave. Otherwise, I'm afraid we are done here."

Ki shook her head, muttering to herself. "I don't like when things go this way. I really do just want to help you all along on your way. Once we make it official, my hands are tied." She looked Eizo square in the face, unblinking.

"I think you misunderstood what I meant by 'my town'. Perhaps a more clear way of putting it is 'my domain'. My full name is Kiyoshi of the Whispers, and in the name of the Grand Tournament, I issue a challenge."

Eizo took a step back his eyes widening. "I am sorry, I had no idea we were dealing with this town's Champion. My apologies for my insolence before."

"I ask you formally now. What are your bounties?"

Eizo raised a hand in a placating gesture. "We really don't have bounties. Please, if you are adamant that we not enter your town untested, we will be on our way. We can find another port."

Seeing Eizo lose his composure only heightened the fear budding in Denri's stomach. But why was she so afraid? She turned back to Kiyoshi. Without moving, the woman's posture had somehow taken a dark, ominous tone.

Denri bristled. "Champion or not, I don't appreciate you trying to put fear in my head."

Kiyoshi cocked her head towards Denri. "I do not put fear inside your head, I only bring out what is already there."

"Denri, watch yourself. We are leaving."

Denri looked over her shoulder at the wilderness behind them. Her heart sank at the thought of another night shivering in the darkness. She turned back toward Kiyoshi, her jaw thrust forward.

"You think I'm afraid? I hope you don't mind being proven wrong. I accept your challenge."

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

Kiyoshi and Denri stood facing one another across a rice paddy, water coming to their calves.

"Since you are unranked, you get to set the terms."

Denri looked to Eizo. "You said go big, right?"

He shook his head violently. "You are not even remotely ready to take on a Champion. You must set the smallest terms possible. This foolishness has cost you your chance to set a high bounty."

"Right, big it is." Denri turned back to Kiyoshi before Eizo could protest. "If I win, you let us into your town with no more questions asked. And from now on, you have to give us a place to stay and your protection if we request it."

Kiyoshi raised an eyebrow. "Well then. That's quite the request. If I win, then, you all must let me look through your heads until I am satisfied. And if I find something that threatens my town, you all will become my prisoners."

"Fair enough."

<HATTORI REVEALS HIMSELF>

"No worry, just thought I'd offer." Ki clapped her hands together. "Well, I've kept you all standing around long enough. You seem like good people, so don't let me keep you any longer. Feel free to swing by if you change your mind. You know where to find me."

The group said their goodbyes and started along the trail toward the town. They made it a few steps before they realized Hattori was still standing in place.

__Perhaps you could train me?__

Eizo turned sharply towards Hattori, but Ki seemed unsurprised. "I was wondering if you were going to say anything."

__You knew?__

She nodded. "I didn't want to pry any more than I needed to get a sense of your intentions. But I could feel your awareness brushing up against mine throughout the conversation."

__I'm sorry. I didn't realize.__

"No need for apologies. It takes a fair bit of training to direct and mask your attention enough that other mind resonants can't feel it. To be honest, I was surprised by how well Aki concealed herself for someone so inexperienced."

Eizo looked at Ki with narrowed eyes. "You do not seem surprised by Hattori's abilities."

She shrugged. "It's weird for a tengu, sure. But there are plenty of monsters the gods made with soul resonance. Maybe Ninigi's tinkering a bit. So long as I don't sense any ill will, I don't mind if he's different."

Aki walked back to Hattori. "She can't train you, Eizo just said we have to keep going."

__I was thinking I could stay, if Ki is willing.__

Aki looked hurt. "You don't want to stay with us? Is it because I got mad at your for hiding in the tree?"

__I do want to stay with you, mistress.__ Hattori looked down at his hands. __But I want to get stronger like you and Denri. I want to understand what I am becoming.__

Aki shook her head, tears spilling down her cheeks. "That's dumb! You're _becoming_ part of our family. I'm sorry I haven't been helping you practice too. Next time we play I can hide and you can look for me."

Hattori shook his head. __Eizo says we can't draw attention to ourselves yet. People will notice my presence if I go into town. But I can rejoin you when you return. It won't be that long. And perhaps I will learn something to teach you as well.__ Hattori turned back to Ki. __Would you accept me as a student for a time?__

"Sure, I figure if I could spare time for the girl I could spare time for you just as well. You're gonna have to help around the fields though."

Hattori bowed deeply to Ki. __Yes, I am happy to help with your daily work. Thank you.__

"No need to thank. It'll be interesting." Ki chuckled. "Who's ever heard of a tengu helping around the house?"

Hattori turned back to the group. __I will wait here while you all explore Sky Furnace. If you cannot return to this town directly, Aki should be able to let me know.__

Aki looked at Hattori, her expression fragile. "You promise you're not trying to leave us?"

Hattori pressed his forehead against hers. __I promise.__ She nodded weakly.

Eizo took a step forward and held out his hand. "If all goes well, you won't have much time. Train hard." As Hattori shook, Eizo held his gaze for a moment. "And stay guarded." The tengu nodded.

Aki elbowed Denri in the side, nudging her towards the tengu.

"I, uh... I'll see you around."

__When you return, I hope to be a better match in our training sessions.__

Denri nodded. "I'm still going to hit you in the face, but it would be nice if it was a more interesting challenge."

"Denri!"

"What! We're being manly. He gets it." Denri turned back to Hattori and shook his hand. "Good luck."

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

Denri stood at the bow of the boat, grinning as the salt spray splashed against her face. Her stomach lurched pleasantly with the rise and fall of the waves. She thought of her parents and smiled.

The ship had no sail, yet somehow it cut forward through the water. Not as fast as the sailboat she grew up on, but still at a reasonable pace. It felt strange to be traveling _against_ the wind.

Weirder still was the body of the boat itself. Gone were the sleek, wooden lines she had known. Thin and light like a needle for cutting through the waves. The vessel they hitched a ride on was chunky, with metal plating and a lot of noisy moving parts.

They didn't have any coin, so working for passage was their only option. And even with Ki's support, the only reason the captain accepted their offer was because Denri was a flit with experience at sea. As much as she wanted to spend the day leaning over the railing staring at the water, Denri had the most weight to pull to earn their keep. She sighed and hopped down from the ledge.

Her work was mostly odd jobs filling gaps in the regular crew. She spent some time helping with the cargo, moving newly acquired heavy items into the lower hold while bringing forward the raw materials to be offloaded at Sky Furnace. When that was done, she helped retie some rigging that had gone astray in a storm a few days ago.

As was common for most sailing crews, nearly everyone was a flit. She'd spent so long in Terminus, dodging knees and careless hands, that being surrounded by her kind was jarring at first. Everything here was sized for her. Everyone shared the same sun-darkened skin.

Every ship had it's own dialect, but they always followed the same utilitarian logic: clear and concise. You didn't have time for shades of grey in the middle of a storm. After a couple hours, Denri had picked up the vernacular, walking wide-stanced and joking with the rest of the crew.

Eizo was doing his best to fit in, though his tall frame was especially conspicuous. She had lost count of how many times the poor man thunked his head trying to duck under something. It _almost_ wasn't funny anymore. To avoid further head injury, he stuck to one place, shoveling peat into a furnace that somehow powered the ship.

Aki had proven so immediately useless, and seasick, that the captain excused her from duty. She hung over the railing at the stern, alternating between petting the cats and puking her guts out. The town had long ago faded from sight, but occasionally she looked into the distance morosely.

<SOMETHING ABOUT MISSING HATTORI>

Denri gave one final tug against some netting that she was retying on the side of the boat, then pulled herself back over the railing. As she landed on the deck, she saw the captain walking by and caught her attention.

"Yes?"

The captain was a flit woman an inch or two taller than Denri. Her dark skin was leathery, with a web of weather-worn wrinkles around her eyes and mouth. Her black, frizzy hair erupted from beneath an oversized cap.

The woman was dressed eclectically. A heavy, body-length coat, frequently patched, hung over a loud, billowing shirt and tight trousers. It was a throwback to the days when flits spent more time pirating than transporting goods for the Five Races.

Despite the interesting garb, Captain Hama was plain in speech. As the one who handled negotiations with clients at port, she was also the only crew member who didn't speak much sailor's cant.

"I was curious about the ship. My family bounced a pretty small route when I was young, but still, I never saw anything like it."

"South coast?"

"Aye, south east. Mostly along Stormcatcher Bay."

The captain whistled. "Tough bounce, that one." Denri felt a moment of pride. "I imagine you wouldn't have seen any hot-irons in an area that angry, though. These girls are clunky, can't follow the storms as well since we're not catching the wind."

"That part confuses me. How do the hot-irons move? I see my friend stoking a fire and they say somehow that's doing it."

"I don't much understand it myself. I figure nobody really does except the Twins and all the bookworms they've got floating around them. But the basic principle is simple enough. We keep a fire going under a big pot of water. That water turns to steam, which spins a wheel under the ship. The wheel pushes us forward. When that stops working, we go back to Sky Furnace and they get it going again."

"Sky Furnace builds the hot-irons?"

The captain nodded. "Sailboats couldn't carry the heavy loads they wanted. And the wind was too unreliable for their tastes. So they did what they always do, built something to do it better.

"For a while now they've been giving a hot-iron to any crew willing to bounce a certain number of supply runs to the Sky Furnace each year. It's a pretty good deal."

"You must've been to Kazora a lot then."

"Going on 10 years now, yeah."

"What's it like?"

The captain laughed. "I don't wanna ruin the spectacle if you're going in fresh. Trust me, the surprise is worth it. There's nothing quite like Sky Furnace. I can say that you'll need to buy masks, though."

"Why?"

"Everyone wears masks in Sky Furnace. Don't worry, they sell 'em in port for people who want to enter the city."

"Why do they wear masks?"

"It's supposed to minimize emotion. They bring in bookworms from all over Yosai with all kinds of different ideas. They've gotta be pretty careful to avoid conflict."

Denri tried to imagine a completely emotionless society. All she saw was a bunch of Eizos walking around stiffly, nodding to each other sternly in passing. She shivered. "That sounds horrible."

The captain shrugged and spit over the railing. "Can't argue with the results. Sky Furnace is one of the most powerful cities in Yosai."

<br />
---
<br />
<br />

The voyage was a relatively short one. Kazora was on Seki, the desolate, volcanic island in Yosai's northwest. Ki's town was almost directly across the strait that separated Seki from the mainland. It was only four days before Sky Furnace came into view on the horizon. Denri was glad the captain didn't spoil the surprise.

At first, she didn't know what they were looking at. A mountain loomed on the horizon, obscured through haze. The summit was oddly lopsided.

A little closer, the mountain began to glow. A billowing cloud poured from the top. A volcano.

Denri hadn't seen many volcanoes in her life, but she had spotted a few in the distance as the four of them crossed the mountains. She was pretty sure their summits weren't supposed to look like what she was seeing now.

A bit closer and Denri realized the summit was moving. Swaying ever so slightly with an unseen breeze. She asked the captain about it.

Captain Hama laughed again. "You'll see soon enough."

Soon the volcano dominated the horizon. Denri had to crane her head backward to see the summit.

Kazora was a massive, very active, volcano. Lava ran down its sides in lazy rivers, casting a dull red under-glow to the surroundings. At its base, shielded from the lava runs by a high metal wall and overflowing with hot-irons, was the port. It filled a crescent bay edge to edge, and Denri couldn't see a single dock that was empty. Even from a distance the chaos of loading and unloading cargo was audible.

At the back of the port was a thick metal cable. Following it up through the ash and haze, the summit finally clicked into place. Denri gasped.

Sky Furnace wasn't _on_ the volcano. It was above it.

Giant, oblong balloons - Hama called them zeplins - floated in the air above the summit. There were hundreds, maybe thousands, tethered in small groups like clusters of grapes. Some were connected by narrow bridges. Others had large, flat platforms making a single flat surface over several balloons.

On top of the zeplins were buildings and parks. One even had a fountain spraying water over its edges with a basin underneath to catch the flow. It had all the pieces of a city, just thousands of feet in the air.

There was a handful of zeplins around the edges in the process of docking with or undocking from the city.

"Whaaaa...?" Denri turned to see Aki standing beside her, slack jawed. The girl's arm was half raised, like she intended to point but lost the train of thought halfway through.

Eizo walked up behind them, looking upward stoically. "Quite the sight, isn't it?"

"'Quite the sight'? _'Quite the sight'?_ It's a fairy tale in real life! Look at this place!"

"Yes, it makes a strong impression."

Denri shook her head as she looked back to the sky. "Unbelievable. Does anything get a reaction out of you?"

The captain returned to the deck after delivering orders to her crew. "We'll wait here for a dock to open up. Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. We aren't staying long and it sounded like you all had business skyward so we won't be able to wait around. I can give you the names of some good captains for the return journey, if you'd like."

Eizo nodded to the woman. "Yes, if you wouldn't mind."

<PUNCHIER ENDING>
