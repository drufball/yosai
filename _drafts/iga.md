Moto snatched his glass and the small bottle of sake off his table just before the two individuals came crashing down, splintering the wood around them. Moto rolled his eyes and slid along the wall, skirting the edge of the brawl. The rest of the bar cheered on drunkenly. It was early morning, but the bar was full as always. At this hour, the low-ceilinged, smoky building was filled with a mix of bleary-eyed all nighters and fresh faced thugs just getting started for the day.

Moto thought about making his way up the rickety, bowed stairs and finishing his drink in his room. But Isa had forbade bringing drinks upstairs and he didn't feel like getting an earful today.

Moto downed the sake in his cup and pressed the rest of the bottle into the hands of a surprised patron. "Knock yourself out." That would probably end up literally. The man gave Moto a suspicious nod, sniffing the contents of the bottle before taking a swig. He winced. The bottle was meant to calm Moto's nerves, not awaken his palette, after all.

Moto took one last look at the two fighting in the corner. Otoya had chosen off some newcomer for sitting in his usual spot. The burly woman hadn't needed much provocation before she'd started laying into the smaller, drunker man. Normally Moto might have jumped in to give Otoya a hand. He enjoyed the crotchety old man's stories. They were obviously lies. But they were fun.

But there would be no intervention today. Moto couldn't risk anything derailing this day. Not again.

Otoya struggled valiantly and vainly beneath the woman. He'd keep on flailing until the woman knocked him out, probably. Moto admired the dedication. Whenever Moto started something, he felt obligated to finish it.

But that's why he didn't pick stupid fights.

Moto gave one last look at Isa's bar. It had been his home for the last two years. A significant chunk of his young life. And he prayed to Tsukuyomi's 9 frosted tails that he would never see the dump again.

He shouldered through the throng of onlookers, all of whom were pressing forward to see how poor old Otoya would fare, and stepped outside. Moto's eyes adjusted quickly to the dim light outside. Wide, moss-covered trees wove between the buildings, their roots spiderwebbed across the road like cobblestones and their branches weaving together tightly overhead. The trees of Koga blocked out the sky above, requiring torches at all times of the day. 

Isa's bar was a few streets off Koga's main market square, but the ceiling of leaves meant noise travelled far in the town. The air was flooded with the sounds of people hawking their wares and haggling over prices a few streets over. Moto took a shaky breath of the cold morning air and blew it out quickly. "Today's the day."

He stepped into the press of traffic and angled himself away from the market. The streets were cramped and winding, picking their way through the forest that grew heedless of the people living within. But Moto knew where he was going. 

As Moto walked, he tightened his grip on the heavy coin pouch at his side. His eyes darted back and forth, interrogating every shadow. People knew today was Selection Day. And no one in Koga was above taking coin from a kid too fool to hang onto it. Moto loosened his dagger in its sheath and quickened his step.

After what felt like an eternity, Moto turned a corner and found himself looking at a thickly knotted stand of trees. They grew so close together that their limbs were interwoven and their trunks pressed into each other, deforming the bark. The Trial Grove. 

Moto took the final stretch at a jog, coming to the Grove's entrance and slamming his coins down in front of a bored-looking man dressed in tight black clothes. Moto let out a sigh and he's shoulders dropped, releasing their tension. "One entry." 

The man looked up from his nails, which he was cleaning with a dagger. His close cropped black hair and goatee were flecked with gray and he wore glasses. His face was stern. "Name?"

The usual entry taker knew Moto on sight. But that was just for a regular pit fight. No one would be placing any bets on Moto or the other fighters today. Not legally at least. So still lots of gambling.

"Moto Tidecliff."

"Age?"

"19."

The man looked up over his glasses, eyes narrowing as he took a closer look at Moto. He leaned forward on an elbow, the muscles in his arm and shoulder showing under the tight clothing. He sat back after a moment, satisfied. "Last chance then." 

The man pulled open the bag and looked at the coins inside. He made a note on a piece of paper before handing Moto a band of metal painted blue. "Put this on your right arm and join the others waiting at the far side of the grove." The man returned to cleaning his fingers.

Moto walked through the bowed wooden archway, stepping into the familiar ring of trees. A few tree trunks jutted into the grove at odd angles and formed alchoves, but the ring was otherwise a well formed circle 100 feet in diameter. The ring was littered with wooden walls and elevated platforms to make the fights more interesting. To Moto's right were the stands, woven into the upper branches of the trees that formed the grove. They were already filling with people. Many wore similar black robes to the man at the entryway.

A motley crew stood at the far wall. Three individuals stood in a small group, chatting nervously. Others stood on their own, sharpening weapons or tightening bindings on their arms. There were 5 individuals, ranging from early teens to Moto's age. Each wore an armband of varying colors. Two brown. Two white. Moto looked at his own arm. That probably meant...

Standing removed from the group was a shorter man. His bright blue armband clashed horribly with his riot of tightly bound red and orange clothing. Like most of the fighters, he was lithe. His arms and legs were long, almost disproportionately so. Bright yellow silks wrapped around his wrists. They dangled from his crossed arms as though weighted.

The man was staring back at Moto, smiling. Long black hair billowed around a handsome face. Moto felt a moment of attraction but quickly suppressed it. He took note of the long hair as a potential weakness for the future. The man beckoned Moto towards him.
