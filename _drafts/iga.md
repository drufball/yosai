Moto snatched his glass and the small bottle of sake off his table just before the two individuals came crashing down, splintering the wood around them. Moto rolled his eyes and slid along the wall, skirting the edge of the brawl. The rest of the bar cheered on drunkenly. It was early morning, but the bar was full as always. At this hour, the low-ceilinged, smoky building was filled with a mix of bleary-eyed all nighters and fresh faced thugs just getting started for the day.

Moto thought about making his way up the rickety, bowed stairs and finishing his drink in his room. But Isa had forbade bringing drinks upstairs and he didn't feel like getting an earful today.

Moto downed the sake in his cup and pressed the rest of the bottle into the hands of a surprised patron. "Knock yourself out." That would probably end up literally. The man gave Moto a suspicious nod, sniffing the contents of the bottle before taking a swig. He winced. The bottle was meant to calm Moto's nerves, not awaken his palette, after all.

Moto looked again at the two fighting in the corner. Otoya had chosen off some newcomer for sitting in his usual spot. The burly woman hadn't needed much provocation before she'd started laying into the smaller, drunker man. Normally Moto might have jumped in to give Otoya a hand. He enjoyed the crotchety old man's stories. They were obviously lies. But they were fun.

But there would be no intervention today. Moto couldn't risk anything derailing this day.

Otoya struggled valiantly and vainly beneath the woman. He'd keep on flailing until the woman knocked him out, probably. Moto admired the dedication. Whenever Moto started something, he felt obligated to finish it.

But that's why he didn't pick stupid fights.

Moto gave one last look at Isa's bar. It had been his home for the last two years. A significant chunk of his young life. And he prayed to Tsukuyomi's 9 frosted tails that he would never see the dump again.

He shouldered through the throng of onlookers, all of whom were pressing forward to see how poor old Otoya would fare, aiming for the door. Moto's eyes adjusted quickly to the dim light outside. Wide, moss-covered trees wove between the buildings, their roots spiderwebbed across the road like cobblestones and their branches wove together tightly overhead. The trees of Koga blocked out the sky above, requiring torches at all times of the day. 

Isa's bar was a few streets off Koga's main market square, but the ceiling of leaves meant noise travelled far in the town. The air was flooded with the sounds of people hawking their wares and haggling over prices a few streets over. Moto took a shaky breath of the cold morning air and blew it out quickly. "Today's the day."

He stepped into the press of traffic and angled himself away from the market. The streets were cramped and winding, picking their way through the forest that grew heedless of the people living within. But Moto knew where he was going. 

As Moto walked, he tightened his grip on the heavy coin pouch at his side. His eyes darted back and forth, interrogating every shadow. People knew today was Selection Day. And no one in Koga was above taking coin from a kid too fool to hang onto it. Moto loosened his dagger in its sheath and quickened his step.

After what felt like an eternity, Moto turned a corner and found himself looking at a thickly knotted stand of trees. They grew so close together that their limbs were interwoven and their trunks pressed into each other, deforming the bark. The Trial Grove. 

Moto took the final stretch at a jog, coming to the Grove's entrance and slamming his coins down in front of a bored-looking man dressed in tight black clothes. Moto let out a sigh and his shoulders dropped, releasing their tension. "One entry." 

The man looked up from his nails, which he was cleaning with a dagger. His close cropped black hair and goatee were flecked with gray and he wore glasses. His face was stern. "Name?"

The usual entry taker knew Moto on sight. But that was just for a regular pit fight. No one would be placing any bets on Moto or the other fighters today. Not legally at least. So still lots of gambling.

"Moto Tidecliff."

"Age?"

"19."

The man looked up over his glasses, eyes narrowing as he took a closer look at Moto. He leaned forward on an elbow, the muscles in his arm and shoulder showing under the tight clothing. He sat back after a moment, satisfied. "Last chance then." 

The man pulled open the bag and looked at the coins inside. He made a note on a piece of paper before handing Moto a band of metal painted blue. "Put this on your right arm and join the others waiting at the far side of the grove." The man returned to cleaning his fingers.

Moto walked through the bowed wooden archway, stepping into the familiar ring of trees. A few tree trunks jutted into the grove at odd angles and formed alcoves, but the ring was otherwise a large, well-formed circle. The ring was littered with wooden barricades and elevated platforms to make the fights more interesting. To Moto's right were the stands, woven into the upper branches of the trees that formed the grove. They were already filling with people. Many wore similar black robes to the man at the entryway.

A motley crew stood at the far wall. Three individuals stood in a small group, chatting nervously. Others stood on their own, sharpening weapons or tightening bindings on their arms. There were 5 individuals, ranging from early teens to Moto's age. Each wore an armband of varying colors. Two brown. Two white. Moto looked at his own arm. That probably meant...

Standing removed from the group was a shorter man. His bright blue armband clashed horribly with the riot of tightly bound red and orange clothing. Like most of the fighters, he was lithe. His arms and legs were long, almost disproportionately so. Bright yellow silks wrapped around his wrists. They dangled from his crossed arms as though the ends were weighted.

The man was staring back at Moto, smiling. Long black hair billowed around a handsome face. Moto felt a moment of attraction but quickly suppressed it. He took note of the long hair as a potential weakness for the future. The man beckoned Moto towards him.

As Moto approached, the man's eyes travelled up and down his body. He didn't make any attempt to hide his assessment of the new challenger entering the ring. His eyes settled back on Moto, his smile widening as though he was satisfied with what he saw. Moto bristled.

Moto had always been a bit scrawny for his age. But over the last two years he had made a point of improving his physique and training with his knives and fists. He would never have the perfectly sculpted muscles and perfectly balanced movements of most of the fighters in the ring, though. Lifting rocks and stabbing tree trunks was only so much of an education.

"It seems that we are teammates."

Moto looked at the rest of the fighters. It did seem that way. His heart sank. The other pairs were tall and lean, with powerful looking builds. The man in red silks was barely five feet tall. "We won't know for sure until they tell us the rules for this Selection Day."

"No, we are teammates. I can feel it." The man extended one of his hands, they yellow silks dangling from the outstretched wrist. Up close, Osoro could see that they _were_ weighted. "I am Keta Gracetouch."

"Moto Tidecliff." Moto shook the man's hand. His grip was surprisingly firm as he pulled Moto into a hug.

"It will be an honor to fight alongside you, Tidecliff." Moto stood, rigid with surprise. Keta was nearly a head shorter than him, so he was able to see the strange looks received from the other competitors. He could feel Keta's hard-muscled arms wrapping around his waist, the man's head pressed against his neck and collarbone. It was probably the most full-hearted hug Moto had received in several years.

Moto patted the man's shoulder uncomfortably. "It's... an honor..."

Keta stepped back, holding Moto's arms and staring into his face with large brown eyes. He made a lot of eye contact. "Ah, we will have to work on those hugs, yes?"

Moto stepped back. Looking around the ring as he changed the subject. "Gracetouch... what does your family do then?"

Keta's short form and large eyes gave him away as a shapeling. Shapelings were a highly adaptive race, their bodies changing over just a couple generations to fit whatever duty they served within their community. Of the five races, shapelings were nearly as common as humans, though it was rare to see them in a setting like this.

Keta held his arms out to either side and bowed deeply. "We are dancers." That explained the strangely long limbs.

"And how did a shapeling dancer end up in the Trial Grove of the Lurkwood? Seems like an odd backstory."

Keta stood, still smiling. "You will not think so once you have seen me fight."

As they spoke, two more fighters entered the ring, sliding red metal bands onto their arms. The man who had been collecting cold at the entrance followed along behind them, closing the doors to the ring. He stopped at the center of the ring with the newcomers and gestured impatiently for the rest of the fighters to approach.

He scanned the young people arrayed before him. "You lot ready?" One fighter made to answer but the man held up a hand. "I don't care. We're starting. You're ready."

The man turned away from the fighters towards the stands. The viewing section was much quieter today. The prohibition on betting meant only the more serious gamblers and bookies bothered attending. Those who did it as a job, not a diversion. The rest of the seats were filled with dark-clothed figures. They were Daggers from Iga.

The man barely raised his voice as he spoke. He made no attempt to whip the crowd into a frenzy or apply any showmanship. "I am Iruka, a Dagger of Iga. Today we honor the contract between our two villages. Two of the fighters here today will be chosen to join our ranks. If they are skilled, someday they will become Daggers themselves."

Iga was a village nestled in the heights of the Shatterspine mountain range nearby. The entire village was a training academy for assassins and infiltrators. Iga's proximity to Koga Forest had created tension over the years. Fighting over contracts. Not to mention Daggers assassinating a few high-profile criminals taking refuge within the Lurkwood's lawless borders. The agreement between the two villages was a way to mingle the ranks and ease the conflict.

It was also Moto's best chance at finding the people who killed his family.

"The rules today are simple. Each fighter wears a colored armband, separating them into teams of two."

Keta elbowed Moto. "You see? As I said."

"Any fighter who collects an armband of each color passes the trial. Anyone who kills another competitor is disqualified. Fighters, please take your positions." Iruka pointed towards four wooden barricades, each painted with a large slash of a team's color.

The four teams split. As they walked, Moto's mind raced. He and Keta both had blue bands, so they didn't have to worry about each other. But Iruka hadn't said anything about teams winning together. Or about anyone being out of the competition if they lost their band. 

Moto glanced at Keta, smiling beside him. Their teamwork would only last as long as they each had their band and therefore didn't need the others'. Teams who could keep both of their bands would have a huge advantage over anyone who was forced to work alone. They should probably stay close then.

To win, a fighter needed a band of each color. That meant there wasn't any reason to rush. No one could win without coming to them. It would be best if they could stay out of the fight, letting the other three teams wear each other down. 

But everyone would know that. Which meant the fight would start carefully, each team trying to avoid getting caught up in a free for all while some team got to sit back and wait. Eventually, they'd split into two separate fights, or they'd all converge in a four way battle.

Moto looked at the other teams. Many were bigger. And he remembered the group of three talking before. They could have an agreement to work together until the end, increasing their odds of success. A free-for-all would be too risky then. Better to isolate another team and force it into two separate fights. 

Moto tried to decide which team represented the least challenge. The two latecomers wearing red appeared to be sisters. They had the lowest chance of turning on each other if one of their bands was taken. That left white or brown. Brown would be on the far side of the square, meaning that engaging them would risk starting a free for all. White it was then.

"Keta, listen. I know what we should do." Moto spoke quietly as they reached their starting position. He kept his eyes on the other teams, trying to guess what they would do.

"Oh?" Keta was bent forward, knees straight and palms flat on the ground, stretching before the battle.

"When things start, I think we should stay close together and aim straight for white team. If we can get one of their bands away from them, I think they'll turn on each other and it'll be easier to get the second band."

"Interesting." Keta straightened and began rolling his shoulders and shaking his legs out.

With the four teams in place, Iruka wasted no time. He raised a hand. "Begin!"

As soon as he spoke, Keta dropped into a crouch, arms flared out behind him. There was a flicker of light as the two torches behind them wavered and then went out. Keta's body began to steam in the cold morning air. "Your plan sounds reasonable. But there's hardly any showmanship to it. I'll take brown and red, you take white."

"That sounds like a terrible-" Keta launched forward in a burst of speed, running faster than anyone Moto had seen before. He was a blur of red as he charged straight towards brown team. Moto cursed and started sprinting after Keta. They needed to stay together or they'd be at a serious disadvantage.

Moto was barely a quarter of the way to brown team by the time Keta reached his opponents. The two men stood warily. They'd had plenty of warning to prepare themselves for Keta's straightforward charge. But as he reached the two men, each a good foot taller than him, Keta leapt. 

The shapeling's small frame flipped through the air, far higher than a normal person should have been able to jump. He twisted as he passed over the two men, striking out with his long arms. The yellow silks dangling from his wrists snapped out. The man on the left just barely managed to pull himself out of the way, stumbling backwards and falling onto his butt. The man on the right yelped in pain as the weight on the end of the silk crunched into his shoulder.

That was all Moto could see before he came skidding to a halt, his way now blocked by two tall, well-built individuals. One was a boy with a shaved head, similar in age to Moto. The other was a girl who looked slightly younger, her body still a bit gangly from recent growth. The two members of white team.

Moto glanced right and saw the two sisters of red team backing against one of the wooden barricades, waiting for the others to tire each other out before they engaged. Moto shook his head angrily.

The boy and girl approached slowly, fanning out to split Moto's focus. He couldn't let the fight devolve into a straightforward two on one. Should he take off his band and give it to them? Maybe they would take it and leave him alone. Or fight amongst themselves for it.

No, if they were smart they would just pick it up and keep coming. Better to make sure he was out of the fight before they turned their back on him. That only left one option. Moto turned and bolted. He heard the two behind him curse and start chasing after him.

Moto ran straight for the nearest platform, hoping the moment of surprise would give him enough of a head start. He took the ladder at a run, planting his foot on a lower rung and throwing his body higher before he started to climb.

He had just reached the top of the ladder when he felt a hand clasp onto his ankle. Moto kicked wildly, tearing his leg free and throwing himself up onto the platform. He rolled along the wood coming to rest on all fours and facing towards the ladder. He saw the man's head and shoulders appear over the platform, scrambling to follow after Moto. Moto waited for the man to get one foot onto the platform before he charged.

The man had clearly expected that Moto might try to defend the top of the ladder. He leapt up quickly, trying to minimize the time his face would be exposed to easy kicks. Moto had counted on that. The man's quick jump left him landing flat footed, unable to move quickly in either direction. He clearly had not expected his opponent to dive tackle him off of the 15 foot platform, sending them both careening into the air.

It was amazing how big an advantage it was to be willing to get hurt in a fight.

As they fell, Moto unwrapped his arms from the man's waist and twisted so his left shoulder pointed towards the ground, right over the man's stomach. Moto forced his muscles to relax, preparing for the impact. The man was too shocked to do much of anything besides flail against Moto's shoulders.

They landed with a dull thud. Moto felt a couple pops as two of the man's ribs broke. A sharp pain blossomed in Moto's shoulder as it took the bulk of the impact. Moto rolled off of the man heavily, eyes screwed shut and groaning in pain. The man himself was doubled over wheezing and gasping for breath, the air knocked completely out of him. His eyes were wide and unfocused.

Not much time until his teammate dropped off the ladder and came running. Moto gritted his teeth and pushed himself to his feet, his left arm dangling and throbbing angrily. He pulled his leg back and kicked the man square in the jaw. Not enough to break his neck, but enough to send his impact-addled mind fully off to unconsciousness. Hopefully.
