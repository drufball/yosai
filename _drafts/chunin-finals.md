It didn't make sense.

Fumi was loud, careless, and overconfident. Always butting into his business. Everything that Moto had struggled tooth and nail for, she had simply been given, yet she had no sense of their value. She was a liability to his plans. She was Soundstealer's daughter.

But she was alone, fighting for her life. And that made Moto mad.

The flame-eaters had done as much as they could, but their healing could only increase the speed of her natural recovery. Her body had healed, but the damage to her head was beyond simply closing wounds. They wouldn't know what impact it had until she woke up. If she ever did.

Moto and Keta had spent the night in the infirmary, speaking little but always staying close to one another. But when the morning came, they had been called back to continue their exam. It seemed the Daggers had little sympathy for fallen comrades.

Soundstealer had never come to visit. When Moto and Keta left, Fumi was alone.

Moto shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts as he climbed the stairs to the platform at the center of the ring. 50 feet square, its surface cracked and uneven from previous matches, the combat ring stood atop a small mountain inside the Playground. On display for all the Daggers to watch.

At the top of the stairs, Moto clapped Keta's wrist. He wanted to pull the shapeling closer, but not with everyone watching. Iruka gave them a sad look as they made their way to opposite sides of the ring.

Fumi's injury had made Moto realize that he cared about her. He couldn't explain it. There was no benefit. She didn't even seem like a good fit as a friend. But after three years alone, thinking he would always be that way, the prospect of losing her was unacceptable.

Moto could finally see Iruka's point of view. There were good people living in Iga. People he liked spending time with, who would watch out for him. But the Daggers as an organization didn't care one way or another. His revenge didn't care.

Throwing his new life away just to pursue those cold, uncaring ideas suddenly seemed crazy. He wasn't even throwing them away to achieve success, just to increase the marginal odds on a long shot victory. Moto shivered. If he followed through with these thoughts, it would change everything.

Moto jumped back to the present as Iruka's hand dropped and the battle began.

Keta charged forward, moving fast, but still not using his resonance. Despite himself, Moto's mind started churning. Was Keta's resonance still fatigued? Or was this just a trick?

Moto jumped back, off the edge of the ring, and swung in a wide arc, coming to rest a good distance from Keta.

The shapeling came to a halt, frustration clouding his face. Moto's resonance gave him a degree of mobility outside the combat area, where Keta would struggle to follow. Keta frowned for a moment, then moved to the center of the ring.

He knew he should be striking, forcing Keta to use his resonance on the defensive. Weakening his already lowered stamina, making sure it was hard for the shapeling to close the distance.

But why? What was the point of this tournament for him? He thought gaining prestige with the Daggers would give him more access, help him move against Soundstealer.

But if revenge would leave no room for Keta, or Fumi, or Iruka, did he want it? He certainly didn't want Keta to end up like Fumi, so why would he try to strike him?

"Why don't you fight?" Keta kept his voice low. Moto thought Iruka could hear, but the other Daggers probably not. The observers shifted along the walls, confused by such a lackluster start.

"I can't..." Moto's face screwed up in frustration. He couldn't what? The last few days felt like running blind through a maze. "I can't stop thinking about Fumi."

Keta's face grew sad, his eyes shimmered. He looked as though he wanted to stop the fight and grab Moto in his arms. Desperate as it seemed, Moto wanted him to. "You have been confused these last few days. I have seen it. Like an older dancer, trying to perform a routine they could do while they were young."

"Everything used to feel so clear. I... you know what I want. But now all I can think about is you and Fumi. And Iruka." Moto shot an embarrassed glance at their teacher. She seemed surprised for a moment, then gave a small smile. "I don't know how you all fit in."

A smile spread across Keta's face, joining Iruka's. His tone brightened and took on an air of playfulness. "Only you could realize you cared for a group of people and decide that you were having a complete mental collapse."

In the corner, Iruka laughed. Despite himself, Moto bristled.

"There is the man I love." Keta dropped into a crouch, thin wisps of steam trailing from his fingers. It seemed his resonance had recovered at least to some degree. "These feelings. For you... they are like stage fright, yes? And there is only one way to deal with stage fright. You must move faster than the doubt can follow."

Keta sprang forward, a wicked grin on his face. For an instant, Moto felt a surge of panic. The way Keta moved reminded him of Hibana's lethal strikes. Moto threw a hand to the side and pulled, trying to arc away from the shapeling.

The pull was weak. Instead of flying wide around Keta, Moto only moved a few feet. He staggered, surprised. He had meant to go much further. What happened?

Keta landed on one foot and pivoted in the same instant, turning to follow Moto's retreat like a cat stalking a mouse. "You will have to be faster than that."

Moto's tactical brain took over. Keta was too close. Moto would have no time to react to his quickened movements. If he stayed at this range, it was only a matter of time before he was overwhelmed. He needed to get away.

Mid stride, Keta pulled his right arm back, twisting his hand in a pattern Moto recognized well. The shapeling was going to use the weighted silks around his wrists to extend his range, trying to catch Moto before he could flee.

Moto pulled a small stone at his feet and shot it toward Keta's wrist, interrupting the movement. At the same time he pulled as hard as he could behind, trying to get some distance.

Again, he only moved a few feet. Even the small stone he threw at Keta seemed to have less impact than he intended. Dimly, some part of his mind realized that his resonance was weakening. All his confusion was finally disturbing the focus he used to call on stone.

He had no time to do anything more than process the thought before Keta closed, eating the last few feet of distance between them. Fighting someone with his speed required absolutely no hesitation, and Moto was full of that right now.

Keta grabbed Moto's shoulders, holding him in place as he coiled into a ball. Moto recognized the move, Keta was going to try to drop kick him out of the ring. Frantically, he slid a foot forward and pulled against Keta's back, throwing the shapeling's balance off so his kick went wide.

As he dropped back to the ground, Keta didn't seem phased by the disruption. He caught himself on both hands and spun, his legs scything through the air in the style Fumi fought. Moto ducked the first blow, then pulled against Keta's hands to make him fall.

Keta laughed, catching his fall in a roll that brought him closer to Moto. "Pulled one way then the other. It is like fighting in a cart as it tumbles down a hill."

Staying low, stance wide, Keta sent two quick jabs toward Moto's stomach. He was adapting to Moto's power quickly. But he had used the same move against Haiyu.

Moto drew his arms across his body, trying as best he could to steer Keta's hands wide by pulling on them with his power. Keta's resonance may be weak, but he was still hitting too hard to block. And he was moving with an easy speed that Moto could barely match.

Moto managed to pull the first blow wide. The second one only glanced his shoulder. It hurt, but nothing like a direct hit would have.

Moto realized he was going head to head with a flame-eater at close quarters. He certainly wasn't winning, and it wasn't Keta's full strength, but he was actually holding the dancer at bay. He had spent so long fighting and training with the shapeling, it seemed like every twitch of Keta's muscles was a glaring announcement of his next move.

The stray observation was one too many. The shapeling blew past Moto's distracted guard and grabbed hold of Moto's belt. He spun around, muscles surging as he lifted Moto in the air and threw him to the ground.

Moto landed heavily on one shoulder, sending pins and needles down the arm, but managed to combine his power with his momentum to regain his feet. Was the arm broken? No, but probably dislocated.

Keta appeared in front of Moto, staying low so Moto couldn't pull him off balance. "Do not think. Move."

He struck forward with both fists and Moto barely managed to spin around them, using Keta as an anchor. The shapeling didn't move an inch. He had adapted completely to Moto's destabilizing pulls.

Keta's arm followed in a backhand aimed at Moto's head. Moto jumped back, pulling to get some distance. He still didn't travel far, but the shapeling let him have a moment to breathe.

"Always weighing, looking for advantages. Doubting. Too afraid of weakness to take a risk trusting those around you.

"Your feelings are what they will be. There is no logic to them. No predicting whether they will bring you happiness or ruin. You are confused because you're trying to think of them as something that can be understood and optimized. But it is a blind leap. Accept or reject. Make your choice."

Keta ran forward again, this time without his resonance. It seemed his stamina had not recovered much.

Moto cursed, realizing he had spent the entire time listening to Keta instead of reclaiming the distance. In a second the shapeling would be on him again. No matter how well he knew Keta's moves, it was only a matter of time until he lost.

Funny how he wasn't thinking of conceding anymore. Keta had gotten under his skin, pulled him out of his head. It seemed everyone on his squad was good at that.

Moto smiled and felt some of his power return with with the sudden decision. "As if the three of you would ever let me reject." As he spoke, his stone cloud rose.

One stone caught Keta on the shoulder, staggering him. Anyone else would have been pummeled by all five, but Keta recovered quickly, jumping and spinning at the same time to find the gap between the projectiles.

Moto hadn't expected to call so many stones at once. It was still short of the number Iruka could manage, but only barely. He could hardly breathe for the focus the cloud required.

Their attention consumed by the stones, the two of them fell into a rhythm like a dance. Keta's body steamed again as he flipped and rolled, sometimes being forced to knock a stone off it's course with the flat of his hand. He had turned his back to Moto, stepping closer. The stones whirred faster as Moto mirrored Keta's steps, trying to keep him at the edge of the cloud.

A stone flying low caught Keta's ankle, pulling him off his feet. Just like that, the dance was done, and two stones were rushing towards Keta at high speed. One for his stomach and one for his head. In horror, Moto grabbed hold and wrenched their orbits wide, sending them flying toward the walls.

A pair of Daggers was forced to duck as one of the stones exploded against the wall. The rest of the stone cloud disintegrated with Moto's loss of focus.

Keta caught himself on his hands and retreated in a series of backflips. His breathing came heavy and there was a trickle of blood at the corner of his mouth, Moto must have clipped him once without realizing. He felt a pang of concern.

Keta smiled, a mix of exasperation and exhilaration. "Do not give me that look."

Keta straightened, wiping the blood from his mouth. "It is like teaching the children their first routine. Once I get the right foot in line, the left goes wandering out of place."

The shapeling pulled his hands above his head, stretching with an air of nonchalance. "But I will not wait another year for you to understand this lesson. You are too stubborn to be left to find it on your own."

The shapeling dropped into a crouch, spreading his stance wide and balling his hands into fists. "Going from using others to protecting them like your collection of fine porcelain is a quarter turn at best. I want the full pirouette. Until you accept the risks of working together, _all the risks_, then you are still just trying to pull the strings."

A torrent of heat erupted from Keta. Just like in the forest, a stiff wind picked up, swirling around the ring and pressing hard against Moto. "If you're going to let me in, then _let me in_."

Moto had seen that look on Keta's face before. It was the same determined look he had when he wanted to save the workers in the burning warehouse. The same look when he was determined to save the prisoners in the spider cave, even though it meant certain death.

It was the same look his father gave him the last time he ever saw him alive.

Moto had little more than a heartbeat to pull his stone cloud back around him before Keta disappeared. The shapeling reappeared at the swirling barrier, catching one of the stones and hurling it into the distance.

The shapeling's legs tensed and he was gone. Then he was upside down above Moto's head, plucking two stones from the air and throwing them away as well. Moto pulled in more to replace them. He was up to seven, desperately trying to keep the barrier dense enough to hold Keta out.

With frightening ease, the shapeling was inside the cloud, landing in a crouch as he smirked at Moto. Moving this fast couldn't be good for his body. Not with his resonance still so taxed from the battle with Hibana. But the shapeling was loving every minute of it, his eyes locked on Moto's face.

The fool was going to get himself hurt. Why couldn't he realize that all his heroics left others picking up the pieces. If Keta died, did he have any care for the sadness Moto would feel? The loneliness that would be left?

But then, that was the point of this performance, wasn't it? Keta was trying to show him that he was strong enough to survive. Strong enough that he wouldn't bend as Moto pleased.

If Moto wanted Keta in his life, he had to accept that the shapeling would choose his own risks, make his own decisions. Worse still, he would drag Moto along on the same foolish quests.

Keta's grin widened as he spun around Moto with ease. With one hand, the shapeling knocked away a stone. With the other, he gripped Moto's dislocated shoulder. A surge of heat filled Moto's arm as it healed. Keta danced away, laughing.

The shapeling was making a challenge. _He_ was strong enough to make good on every one of his lofty ideals. The only question was whether Moto was strong enough to keep up. Moto bristled.

He sent the stones in his cloud careening toward the shapeling. Keta's body twisted with seeming nonchalance as he dodged the stones. In reality, his motion was a blur. Moto cursed. The dancer was too fast to hit with anything he threw.

Fine. If Keta was determined to be as dumb as his father, then Moto had no other choice. But see if he could get himself killed with Moto right there beside him, watching his back.

Keta stumbled as Moto's power pulled in all directions, shifting gravity toward him. But that was only a side effect. Iruka had mentioned that the strongest resonants could do more than manifest elemental energy through their bond. They could enforce their will on their element, shaping it in the world around them.

Keta had made his point, and Moto thanked him for it. Grudgingly. But not a chance would he let the shapeling go dancing around, showing off like he could get his way whenever he wanted.


All traces of hesitation were gone as Moto reached out and grabbed the stone at the Keta's feet. He could dodge anything Moto threw at him, but how would he handle this?

The rock shifted. Keta's eyes widened in surprise, but it would take more than that to catch him flat footed. A wave of steam rolled off his muscles and he was gone.

Truly gone. The shapeling moved so fast Moto's eyes didn't even catch a blur.

He reappeared in Moto's face, legs brought up to his chest, but Moto knew how the shapeling fought. He had already grabbed the stone at his feet, reshaping it into a wall to shield him. Keta's legs snapped out and the rock wall shattered.

Moto caught the stones, pulling them in a tight loop behind before launching them at the shapeling before he could land. Somehow Keta spun himself as he fell, knocking away the projectiles with two tight kicks.

But the stones were only a distraction. Moto grabbed the earth below and sent a pillar crashing into Keta. The shapeling grunted in surprise as he was knocked upward.

Moto coiled the earth beneath his own feet and launched himself in the air as well, building momentum. He latched on to Keta and pulled. It felt right to use a variant of Fumi's strategy.

Keta changed directions sharply, as though he had hit an invisible wall and bounced off. He managed to unfurl his silks and land a solid blow against Moto's shoulder before the shapeling was careening past, helpless as he flew off the edge of the ring.

The last thing Moto saw before Keta went crashing into the trees was the shapeling's smile. Moto landed roughly, barely managing to pull behind and stay inside the ring himself.

He heard Iruka calling his name. He had won.

It was Moto’s turn to lean against the railing at the edge of the Playground. Keta was gone, hauled off to the infirmary to treat his falling injuries as well as his extreme exhaustion. Moto wanted to go with him, but he wanted to watch the match between Hako and Hibana first.

The two recruits— chunin now, Moto corrected himself— stood in the ring, waiting on Iruka to begin the match. Moto watched with a sort of feral glee.

He hoped Hibana would win. With his newfound ability, he wasn’t afraid to meet her in the finals. And he had some payback to deliver on behalf of Fumi. Hibana had joined his list of revenge targets, even if it was a smaller goal than Soundstealer.

If she lost, Moto hoped she fought tooth and nail, and that Hako left her badly battered. His only fear was that they might pull the same stunt as Haiyu.

As if enacting his thoughts, Iruka dropped her hand and Hibana turned toward the stairs. She stalked like a caged panther, shoulders hunched with the difficulty of restraint.

“I concede.” She bit the words off like a deer’s throat.

Moto ground his teeth, his fists balling against the railing. What were they up to? Not knowing bothered him. Almost as much as his frustration at being unable to pound Hibana flat.

Moto pushed off in a huff, muttering a string of curses under his breath. Another time. Hibana would regret what she did to Fumi. For now, He would have to settle for venting his frustrations against Hako.

Moto’s knees wobbled, still weak from his battle with Keta, and he cursed at that too.

<br />

<br />
<br />

When Moto and Iruka entered the infirmary, Keta was sitting upright in bed. Apparently, the shapeling had insisted his bed be brought next to Fumi’s under threat of moving it there himself. He sat now with one hand protectively on Fumi’s unconscious shoulder.

When he saw them enter, Keta tipped his head sideways inquisitively. “So soon?”

“Hibana conceded.” Moto immediately regretted his sharp tone. “Sorry. I just wanted to fight her.”

“For one who claims to be so new to having friends, you seem quite practiced at swearing vengeance for fallen comrades.”

Moto’s eyes widened, and it was all he could do not to glance nervously in Iruka’s direction. But the teacher didn’t seem to have noticed Keta’s remark.

“You’ll get another chance someday, kid. The Daggers never miss a chance to pit us against each other.”

“Good.” Moto dropped himself onto Keta’s bed, carelessly enough to make the shapeling wince. That would have to do as punishment for now. Five minutes working together and the shapeling was already making him regret it.

Keta adjust his feet into Moto’s lap and Moto felt a flash of discomfort. Apparently he didn’t like feet. It was a realization about himself that he’d never had the opportunity to have. Moto couldn’t help but laugh as he pushed Keta’s feet away.

The shapeling looked at him quizzically, but seemed content just to see Moto happy. He adopted a hurt air as he pulled his feed beneath him on the bed. “Hardly a day as squad leader and already he can’t be bothered to give a foot rub.”

Moto blinked, momentarily confused until he got Keta’s reference. “That’s right, isn’t it? I got further than you and Fumi, so that makes me squad leader.” Moto grinned.

“Fumi might take issue when she wakes.” All three of them ignored the sliver of hesitation in Keta’s final words. “She will claim the bet was for whoever won the tournament.”

Iruka looked between them. “Sounds like you three have decided to stay together after the tournament then?”

Moto nodded as he wrestled Keta’s legs out from under him, forcing past his discomfort to give the shapeling the foot rub he requested. Iruka smiled as Keta began to squirm. It turned out the shapeling was ticklish. Moto clamped down on Keta’s ankles, the shapeling’s discomfort paying for Moto’s own.

Abruptly, Iruka’s face became serious. It took Moto a moment to realize why she cleared her throat. He could still hear Keta’s protests, but otherwise the room had gone silent. The ruffling of covers, faint breathing, the sounds of people walking by outside the window. All were gone.

Moto turned, knowing what he would find.

“Soundstealer.” Iruka nodded to the man, her face harder than the stone of her resonance.

“Stonesong.” Soundstealer inclined his head a fraction, then turned his attention to Moto.

Moto dropped Keta’s feet like they were made of flames, shooting to his feet as fast as he could. Just like before, his heart leapt into his throat. The man had a presence that permeated his surroundings with threat. The air itself seemed to press in.

It probably was, Moto realized. Just as he had commanded stone earlier, Soundstealer was probably holding the air around him. But unlike Moto, he did not have to be selective. Every scrap of air in the room was deadened, held in Soundstealer’s iron grip. Moto wondered if the man even let go in his sleep.

Somehow, understanding the power better only made it more intimidating.

“A word, Moto.” It was not a request, and Moto was three steps in following Soundstealer out the door before he even stopped to consider whether he should follow.

Moto wiped his palms along his pants. What did the man want? He remembered the moment earlier in the tournament, had Soundstealer really been staring at him after all? Did he know?

Moto turned back to Keta. His nerves must have shown on his face, because the shapeling pushed himself to the edge of the bed, getting ready to follow.

“I did not request your presence.” Soundstealer had reached the door.

“These kids are trying to spend time with their teammate. Your daughter, Soundstealer. Though I wouldn’t expect you to trouble yourself on that account.” Iruka looked as though she had bitten into something sour.

“She will still be here when he returns.” Soundstealer turned back to Moto. He did not look impatient. Nor did he look like there was any chance but for Moto to do as he was told.

“It’s OK Iruka. I’ll make it quick.” Surely Soundstealer couldn’t just kill him? Not so blatantly. Or if he could, if he had evidence of Moto’s intervention and it was enough to justify his death, then surely he was beyond saving whether he went with Soundstealer now or not.

After all his actions so far, all his eagerness to work with Soundstealer, it would be suspicious for him to refuse an audience now. Moto took a steadying breath. He wished it wasn’t so hard to keep a clear head around the man.

Keta squeezed his shoulder and gave an encouraging nod as Moto walked to the door.

<br />

<br />
<br />

It was an odd feeling, walking outside in Soundstealer’s bubble of silence. At least indoors, it was easy enough to forget and think the room was just quiet. But now Moto could see the sources of all the sounds that did not reach him.

“An impressive showing today. You are the first Terran with a bond strong enough to command stone in many years. I thought Iruka might have, but then... The flame-eater holds potential as well.”

“Thank you.” Moto’s skin crawled at the compliment. Soundstealer was the last person he wanted to hear it from. Except maybe Hibana.

“Why do you thank me? The power is your own. I do nothing but acknowledge it. You have come to the ability recently, I imagine. Else there would have been some sign of it in the ashes of Genji’s warehouse.”

In any other scenario, Moto would have been proud that the surprise tactic did not make him miss a step. But he did not think Soundstealer was even trying a tactic. The man spoke casually because he was completely unconcerned by whatever Moto chose to do. Besides, Moto’s heart was beating so loudly in his ears that Soundstealer had to hear it, whether Moto gave the truth away with his stride or not.

“I’m not sure—.”

Moto’s voice cut off in a strangled gasp as a massive weight wrapped itself around his chest and throat. The breath in his lungs wheezed out as his chest was compacted by the air around him. He reached for his throat reflexively, but his arms were held at his side.

“Do not waste my time. Two men clad in the robes of Daggers were seen running from the warehouse, meeting your description. If you did not want me to know, you should not have stayed to help the useless workers. Whatever stupidity gripped you then, do not infect my presence with it now.”

The pressure subsided. The exchange had been fast enough that no one noticed Moto’s brief paralysis. But the point had been made. Moto gasped for breath. He doubted anyone around them could hear it.

“What do you want?” Moto rubbed his throat as casually as he could manage.

“Which one of the fools do you work for?”

This time Moto really was confused. “I don’t—.” Pins and needles, sharp as blades skittered across his throat and Moto came up short. He had stepped into something bigger than he realized here, and it didn’t seem there was much room for error. He needed time to think. “They’ll kill me.”

A sharp cut opened on his cheek.

“And I will not? I assure you neither Danzo nor that brute Breaker has enough sway to protect you here. Even if I had no interest in killing you, Amaya’s little pets seem bent on removing you. Your master has served you poorly, boy. If you have any sense you will realize that your only hope to live lies in pleasing me.”

The first name meant nothing to Moto, but he had heard Breaker before. For one frantic heartbeat he feared he would be unable to recall. But then blessed memory clicked into place. The thugs at the warehouse had been interrogating the prisoner about Breaker. But what was this about Amaya? What did the Silence of the Four Seasons have to do with anything?

Moto let his face fall in what he hoped was a broken look. At the very least, the fear was not at all feigned. “Breaker.”

Soundstealer nodded curtly. “I thought as much. The whole thing reeked of his particular brand of clumsiness. Tell me, what did he want you to achieve? Does he hope to expose me, having you attach yourself to my daughter as you have?”

This was the crucial moment. There was no way Moto could keep a charade like this up for any length of time. He needed to sell Soundstealer something that would foreclose further questions. He had a guess, based on what he had heard during the interrogation in Jidoka and the way powerful people generally treated underlings. But it was only a guess.

“I wasn’t told much. Something about a town being destroyed. He wanted me to figure out which of your clients had ordered it, then take them out.” It felt weird to so nearly be spouting the truth. But it was close to what the warehouse thugs had seemed interested in.

Soundstealer paused for a moment, staring at Moto’s face. It seemed he was doing it only to torture Moto, though he was probably trying to see through any lies. Under that glare, it was a challenge not to swallow like a frightened rabbit.

“Fool.” Moto’s stomach tightened before Soundstealer continued. “Three years and he’s still upset about something so foolish? He knows I had no choice. My connection to Sadashi’s network is too valuable to throw away. Certainly not over some pet Hero of Breaker’s. The Last Standing himself was there. If I hadn’t acted, Hisoka’s plan would have been laid bare.”

Moto felt like he had been slapped in the face. There was so much packed into that single outburst, it left his mind reeling. It clearly was not meant for him to hear. It carried the tenor of a well worn debate, something rubbed raw and emotional for Soundstealer. That meant whoever this Breaker was, Soundstealer had some connection to him.

It sounded like they worked together. But in Jidoka, it sounded like Breaker opposed whoever this merchant was that Soundstealer worked for. It must all be wrapped up in whatever this plan of Hisoka’s was. Iruka had mentioned Soundstealer abandoned her on some sudden request from Iga’s ruling Champion.

All of these thoughts were processed dimly at the back of Moto’s mind. At the forefront was the realization that this well worn frustration between Breaker and Soundstealer was Moto’s village. Three years was exactly the right amount of time. Whoever this Last Standing was, Moto added him to his list.

Soundstealer composed himself with visible effort, rubbing his eyes with two fingers. “You are lucky, boy. I believe there is a way for you to be of use to me, so I will make you an offer that lets you keep you skin.” With a sickening dread, Moto thought that might not have been a figure of speech.

“You are strong. Your showing today showed as much. Strong enough to be effective. If I can move against Sadashi, more than simply spying, the rewards from Hisoka would be immense. Immense enough for me to share a fraction with any who would help me achieve such an end...”

“You’re asking me to betray Breaker?” Moto put just a touch of indignation in his voice. Let Soundstealer think he had broken through some barrier and he would believe the lie. How was it that manipulating a master assassin was so much easier than dealing with Keta when he was angry?

“I’m asking you not to be an idiot who throws his life away. Breaker has obviously told you precious little. Probably thinks he’s being coy and devious. But that lack of information has left you blundering around like a fool in the dark. I’ve tried to keep you away from my daughter to minimize suspicion, but look how that turned out.”

Moto tried to hide his confusion. Soundstealer spoke like Fumi’s fight with Hibana was his fault.

Then realization smacked him in the face. Amaya’s pets. Hako and Hibana were both from north of the Fox Fangs, where the coldest of the Four Seasons made her domain. And Haiyu’s last name was Threerivers, for the waterways that divided Jidoka. Had they all been coming after Moto’s squad for his investigations?

“The merchants that Breaker would have you move against, I would also like to see investigated, though for different reasons. Sadashi always has his spies around, though, so my hands have been tied. But with you supposedly acting on Breaker’s commands, I suddenly have a path before me.

“I can feed you the information you need, so that you can pick targets more intelligently. Breaker will think you make outstanding progress. But you will be working for me. And when you ultimately find what I am after, you will be rewarded far beyond whatever pittance Breaker offered you.”

“And what are you after?”

Soundstealer raised an eyebrow. “So you accept my offer then?”

Moto slumped his shoulders, looking defeated. “It doesn’t seem like I have any other choice.”

Soundstealer nodded. “Prudent. I am looking for a child. Or rather, one of many children. Sadashi has sent me on many missions involving children. Escorting them. Retrieving them. Killing them. He’s doing something. But I could never move on a mission he had given explicitly to me. I will give you the locations where several of these children were taken. I want you to find out what Sadashi is doing and retrieve one of these children if you can.”

“Won’t Breaker be suspsicious if I change targets?”

“You won’t be. The first place I’d have you look is the very same woman who ordered his precious little hero killed.”

Moto hoped he was keeping his eagerness hidden. Could he really be this lucky? How had certain death become exactly what he sought after?

“We will discuss logistics further at another time. With you winning the exam tournament, no one will look askance at me courting you.”

“I haven’t won the tournament yet, though.”

“But you have. What with Hako and his squad disappearing in the night. Consider it an early payment from your new benefactor.”

Well, that answered the question of whether Soundstealer really could just kill anyone he wanted in the town. If that had ever really been in doubt. “Won’t that make others suspicious?”

“It is necessary. If you fought him, there is a good chance you would die, even with your newfound ability. Besides, you winning will create a useful cover for us to communicate. I can have it handled without being implicated. I’ll have to make it seem as though you handled them to Amaya, though.”

“Perhaps if you only drive them off. Amaya would never believe you would do something so obvious. If you make your involvement hidden but easy to weed out, perhaps it will seem like revenge for what Hibana did to Fumi and nothing more. The easiest way to sell a lie is to let them think they’ve figured out your trick.”

Soundstealer was thoughtful for a moment before nodding. He seemed mildly impressed. “It is not an altogether foolish idea. I will think on it.”

There. Keta couldn’t say he hadn’t at least tried to take the higher path. He would have loved for Hibana to meet an untimely end, though.

“What about Keta?” Moto felt a moment of hesitation. He didn’t want to draw the shapeling into this. But he knew what decision Keta would make if he had the choice. Moto had promised to respect that. Even if the promise was in the form of a pillar of rock knocking the shapeling through a few trees. “He’s my partner.”

Soundstealer waved a hand. “You can keep your squad. I would have preferred you not involve my daughter, but I suppose it can’t be helped. If you’re found out I can claim that you got your information from her and safely excise all three of you. If she doesn’t wake up, I’ll find someone else with tenuous connections to me who can join your group.”

Moto knew color had risen to his cheeks. How could the man talk about his daughter so callously? Moto looked away to hide his anger.

As he turned his face away from Soundstealer, Moto realized they were back at the infirmary. He had been so absorbed with keeping up with the conversation, he hadn’t looked at all where they were going.

“I will leave you for now. We will talk again once Hako and the others are gone and you are declared winner. If anyone asks I am considering you for one of my teams, but want you to prove yourself further first.”

Just like that Soundstealer was gone. Moto stepped into the infirmary, taking a shaky breath. His hands quivered so badly he had to hold them behind his back as he walked back into the room with his squad.

Keta caught his eye and gave a questioning look. Moto gave a quick nod that said he would tell him later. And he would. He was decided now.

Iruka cast a nervous glance at the cut on his cheek, but Moto brushed it aside as he sat down. “Well, in that case you missed some news. The doctor said Fumi looks like she’ll make it through. Their still concerned she might have some difficulties from the head wound, but she’s going to make it.”

A flood of relief washed over Moto. He looked over the three people in the room. Iruka, tilting back in her chair with boots up on the end of Fumi’s bed. Keta, covered in bandages but looking at him tenderly. Fumi, lying unconscious beside them, but somehow looking stubborn and cocky while she did it.

Everything had changed after that conversation with Soundstealer. He was suddenly playing a much more precarious game. But all he could think about now was Fumi. And spending time with his new...

Moto shook his head ruefully. He shouldn’t let himself get so carried away. One step at a time. But still, he smiled.
