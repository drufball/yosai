# Casing the joint
"Watch it." The man struck Denri on the shoulder and sent her spinning to the ground. His large frame loomed, covering her in shadow. She couldn't see his face beneath a rough-woven conical hat, but Denri figured the man's range of facial expressions was about as small as the chance he could scratch his head with the tree trunks that he called arms. 

Probably a sneer, but she wouldn't bet against something lewd either.

"Sorry, sir." Denri scrambled backwards on all fours, looking towards the ground. She hunched her shoulders, shrinking her frame even further. She was average height for a flit, but at three and a half feet tall the other four races liked to see her as a child. Now probably wasn't the best time to correct the misconception.

The man scoffed and turned away, shouldering through the thick market crowd. Denri made a face then joined it with an obscene gesture. She pushed herself off the ground and dusted the dirt from her butt. She pulled her arm from behind her back and tossed the brute's coin purse in the air. There was a crudely stitched skull across the front.

"Of course there is." Denri smiled.

She wove through the crowd, moving away from the man. She noted what direction he traveled so she could check on him later. People like that had a habit of hurting Denri's friends.

Denri bounced back and forth, dodging knees and swinging hands. She hadn't gone far before she noticed a gap moving through the crowd. At its center was a dour face attached to a lean-muscled, feminine form. Most of Daggerstorm's knives were hidden, but people saw enough to understand her desire for personal space.

Behind Denri, a male voice started yelling about a misplaced coin purse stitched with a skull. A wicked thought caught Denri's attention.

She pocketed a few coins from the pouch, then went bouncing up to Daggerstorm, eyes bright and innocent. "Miss! Miss!" Denri grabbed one of Daggerstorm's calloused hands. The dangerous woman looked down at Denri and frowned, but she didn't snatch her arm back. 

"Sorry, child. I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment." She dug in the pouch at her side, pulling out a coin.

"Is it true? Is it true?"

Daggerstorm hesitated, coin halfway out of the pouch. "Is what true?" Denri eyed the coin hungrily, but forced the reflex down. Daggerstorm was one of the good ones.

Denri threw an accusing arm over her shoulder. "That big man in the straw hat says he tossed you in a fight last night, no problem! But I said no way. Daggerstorm is the toughest Hero in all of Terminus and nobody tosses her!"

Daggerstorm's frown deepened. She thrust her chin towards the man, who was now shaking down a merchant and making a ruckus about pickpockets. "That one there?"

"Yeah, he's tellin' anyone who'll listen."

Daggerstorm dropped the coin into Denri's hand and pushed past her. "Excuse me while I go have a word with this man."

"Yeah! Teach that dirty liar a lesson!" Denri gave Daggerstorm an encouraging pat on the back and slipped the man's coin purse onto her belt, skull facing out. Just to make sure both sides had the appropriate motivation.

A few moments later, Denri was rewarded by the high-pitched whine of a man begging for mercy. Her smile widened.

Terminus was a rough town, but it was a kind one too. No one bugged you if you weren't causing trouble. Hero's shared a bit of coin with the beggars. Crime had the decency to stay organized and underground. But it didn't get that way by accident. 

Denri slipped Daggerstorm's coin into her shirt, next to the handful of coins she'd taken from the man. A generous reward for meting out some much-needed justice. Just doing her part.

Denri made her way to the edge of the street and prepared to slip into one of the many dark, twisty alleyways that snaked between the tall buildings of Terminus. But before she could slip away to safety, an opportunity caught her eye.

She was standing in the shadow of a wide, ornate building. A steeply angled roof curved towards the sky at the bottom, deep blue shingles shining like dragon scales in the afternoon sun. A pair of lion dog statues stood vigil at the corners. Denri knew the place. A gang house belonging to Danzo, one of the larger crime bosses of the city.

The guards watching the front entrance had taken a few steps forward, turning their back to the door as they craned their necks to get a view of Daggerstorm and her latest prey. Denri was inching along the wall towards the door before she'd even processed all the information. Not that any thought could have made her do something as blasphemous as wasting an opportunity anyways.

The lax guards probably meant more security inside, but she could face that problem when it came. Denri passed behind the guards and reached the doorway without issue. She blew a kiss towards the sky, thanking the Stormbringer for her good luck, then ducked through the entrance.

The hallway on the other side was dimly lit, the air noticeably cooler. It stretched deeper into the building before ending in a T-intersection. Denri stuck to the shadows, waiting for her eyes to adjust. Once she was ready, she dropped into a crouch and inched towards the the corner of the intersection. She pulled a heavily worn dagger from her belt, fogged it with her breath, then rubbed it with the cleanest scrap of her shirt she could find.

Not exactly a mirror-finish, but the dagger was bright enough to reflect small blobs that approximated their real shape. Denri slid the blade along the floor, using it to peer around each corner.

The left hallway ended in another turn. A dull glow spilled out from deeper in the building. A few low, stern voices accompanied the dim lamplight from wherever it emanated. To the right, a few doorways branched off the hallway befor it dead-ended in darkness.

The money and other valuables were probably deeper in the house, behind the serious voices to the left. But she wasn't itching to make an enemy out of one of the most dangerous men in Terminus. Just score a couple nice meals for her and her friends. Denri took the right hallway and started peering through the cracks between doors.
