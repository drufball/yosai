# Casing the joint
"Watch it." The man struck Denri on the shoulder and sent her spinning to the ground. His large frame loomed, covering her in shadow. She couldn't see his face beneath a rough-woven conical hat, but Denri figured the man's range of facial expressions was about as small as the chance he could scratch his head with the tree trunks he called arms. 

Probably a sneer, but she wouldn't bet against something lewd either.

"Sorry, sir." Denri scrambled backwards on all fours, looking towards the ground. She hunched her shoulders, shrinking her frame even further. She was average height for a flit, but at three and a half feet tall the other four races liked to see her as a child. Now probably wasn't the best time to correct the misconception.

The man scoffed and turned away, shouldering through the thick market crowd. Denri made a face then joined it with an obscene gesture. She pushed herself off the ground and dusted the dirt from her butt. She pulled her arm from behind her back and tossed the brute's coin purse in the air. There was a crudely stitched skull across the front.

"Of course there is." Denri rolled her eyes.

She wove through the crowd, moving away from the man. She noted what direction he traveled so she could check on him later. People like that had a habit of hurting Denri's friends.

Denri bounced back and forth, dodging knees and swinging hands. She hadn't gone far before she noticed a gap moving through the crowd. At its center was a dour face attached to a lean-muscled, feminine form. Most of Daggerstorm's knives were hidden, but people saw enough to understand her request for personal space.

Behind Denri, a male voice started yelling about a misplaced coin purse stitched with a skull. A wicked thought caught Denri's attention. She smiled.

Denri pocketed a few coins from the pouch, then went bouncing up to Daggerstorm, eyes bright and innocent. "Miss! Miss!" Denri grabbed one of Daggerstorm's calloused hands. The dangerous woman looked down at Denri and frowned, but she didn't snatch her arm back. 

"Sorry, child. I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment." She dug in the pouch at her side, pulling out a coin.

"Is it true? Is it true?"

Daggerstorm hesitated, coin halfway out of the pouch. "Is what true?" Denri eyed the coin hungrily, but forced the reflex down. Daggerstorm was one of the good ones.

Denri threw an accusing arm over her shoulder. "That big man in the straw hat says he tossed you in a fight last night, no problem! But I said no way. Daggerstorm is the toughest Hero in all of Terminus and nobody tosses her!"

Daggerstorm's frown deepened. She thrust her chin towards the man, who was now shaking down a merchant and making a ruckus about pickpockets. "That one there?"

"Yeah, he's tellin' anyone who'll listen."

Daggerstorm dropped the coin into Denri's hand and pushed past her. "Excuse me while I go have a word with this man."

"Yeah! Teach that dirty liar a lesson!" Denri gave Daggerstorm an encouraging pat on the back and slipped the man's coin purse onto her belt, skull facing out. Just to make sure both sides had the appropriate motivation.

A few moments later, Denri was rewarded by the high-pitched whine of a man begging for mercy. 

Denri hummed to herself as she slipped Daggerstorm's coin into her shirt, next to the handful of coins she'd taken from the man. A generous reward for meting out some much-needed justice. 

Denri liked Terminus. No one bugged you if you weren't causing trouble. Hero's shared a bit of coin with the beggars. Crime had the decency to stay organized and underground. But it didn't get that way by accident. 

Just doing her part.

Denri made her way to the edge of the street and prepared to slip into one of the many dark, twisty alleyways that snaked between the tall buildings of Terminus. But before she could slip away to safety, an opportunity caught her eye.

She was standing in the shadow of a wide, ornate building. A steeply angled roof curved towards the sky at the bottom, deep blue shingles shining like dragon scales in the afternoon sun. A pair of lion dog statues stood vigil at the corners. Denri knew the place. A gang house belonging to Danzo, one of the larger crime bosses of the city.

The guards watching the front entrance had taken a few steps forward, turning their back to the door as they craned their necks to get a view of Daggerstorm and her latest prey. Denri was inching along the wall towards the door before she'd even processed all the information. Not that any thought could have made her do something as blasphemous as wasting an opportunity anyways.

The lax guards probably meant more security inside, but she could face that problem when it came. Denri passed behind the guards and reached the doorway without issue. She blew a kiss towards the sky, thanking the Stormbringer for her good luck, then ducked through the entrance.

The hallway on the other side was dimly lit, the air noticeably cooler. It stretched deeper into the building before ending in a T-intersection. Denri stuck to the shadows, waiting for her eyes to adjust. Once she was ready, she dropped into a crouch and inched towards the the corner of the intersection. She pulled a heavily worn dagger from her belt, fogged it with her breath, then rubbed it with the cleanest scrap of her shirt she could find.

Not exactly a mirror-finish, but it was bright enough to reflect small blobs that approximated real shapes. Denri slid the blade along the floor, using it to peer around each corner.

The left hallway ended in another turn. A dull glow spilled out from deeper in the building. A few low, stern voices accompanied the dim lamplight from wherever it emanated. To the right, a few doorways branched off the hallway before it dead-ended in darkness.

The money and other valuables were probably deeper in the house, behind the serious voices to the left. But she wasn't itching to make an enemy out of one of the most dangerous men in Terminus. Just score a couple nice meals for her and her friends. Denri took the right hallway and started peering through the cracks between doors.

The third door she checked contained the food. Denri tried the sliding paper door but found it locked. She took a step back and dropped into a squat, squinting at the door while she thought. She could shoulder through the wooden frame easily enough, but the sound would draw guards. Dancing around the guards sounded fun. But from what she could see through the crack beneath the door, all the food was in crates. She might need some time to pry them open.

Denri sighed, bored by the lack of forward progress. She moved back to the door and dropped to her stomach so she had a view into the room. She took a mental step forward, under the door frame.

Denri's body tensed and her vision flickered a bright white-blue. There was a faint crackle in the air as her body shifted into a flow of electricity that jittered under the door frame. An instant later, she was standing on the other side, dusting her hands off with a self-satisfied smile.

Denri didn't have a resonance. Not like all the Hero's training in Terminus. But the Stormbringer was close to all of their creations. All flits had the ability to shift, even if it was hard on the body. Denri's muscles ached like she had climbed a mountain. She wouldn't be able to shift again until she had a chance to sleep off some of the strain. But at least now she could keep moving.

Denri made her way to the crates and used her dagger to pry a few open. "Jackpot." Her stomach grumbled reflexively as she stared down at the feast in front of her. She looked up at the ceiling briefly. "Thanks again, boss." 

She hopped up, resting her waist along the edge of the crate as her upper body disappeared into the container. Denri hesitated, her eyes darting between apples, cheese, and some dried meat. She chewed her lip with a look of serious contemplation.

She came up for air a second later, struggling vainly to close her mouth around all three.

A few minutes later, every pocket on Denri's person was testing the strength of it's threadbare seams. Denri's face was a mess of grease and sticky fruit juices. She smacked her lips and licked her fingers clean. She was looking forward to all the stomach aches she was about to have. A rare luxury.

She replaced the last lid and looked around. Her belly was full, but she was a bit disappointed. She would have thought infiltrating one of Danzo's lairs would have been more exciting. Sure, she was only filching a few days of fancy food. But still. It had been a bit anticlimactic.

She'd just have to make a bit of fun for herself, then. Denri dug around in one of her pant pockets, feeling her way around a handful of dried meat, until she found the bundle of leather she was looking for. She unrolled the bundle on one of the crates, revealing an assortment of colored chalks. Denri picked a few colors and stepped up to the wall, face screwed up in concentration. 

She started with her usual calling card. A crudely drawn thundercloud with a mocking face and a suggestively placed lightning bolt. She had never seen Danzo before, so she drew what she imagined every rich old man looked like and put a name underneath. She added white squiggles around Danzo to show him being electrocuted by the phallic lightning.

She took a step back, framing the drawing between her fingers and admiring her work. Denri was no artist, but everyone would get the joke. She closed her mouth to stifle a burp, her cheeks puffing out. "Thanks for the loot, Danzo buddy." She saluted the drawing and turned to the door, pushing against the handle.

It didn't budge.

"Ohhhh. Right. Still locked." She didn't worry much. It was hard to be upset after such a nice meal. Besides, this was not the first time Denri had shifted into a locked room with no way out. Another opportunity would come along. And she still had her plan of throwing herself through the door frame.

Denri did a quick circuit of the room, looking for other doors or windows. Nothing. She walked back to the door and jammed a hairpin in the lock, twisting it back and forth until the thin metal broke. The door remained obstinately closed. Obvious ideas exhausted, Denri jumped up onto a food crate and sat with her chin resting on her hands as she stared at the door. "Hmmm..."

Denri woke a couple hours later. She lay sprawled across the food crate, her left arm asleep beneath her body. She sat up in a daze, wiping a stream of drool off her cheek. What was she doing again?

"I swear I heard something coming from the storage room." The voice came attached to a pair of boots tromping down the hall.

Right. Escaping from the room.

"You're always jumping at the wind. I didn't hear anything." The boots had a friend.

"Honest! It sounded like some kind of growling or something. Do you think an animal got in? Boss will kill us if all the food is ruined." A warm glow shown through the thick paper walls. Two shadows made their way to the storage door. It jiggled. 

"See? Locked. No way an animal got in."

"Let's just check to make sure." There was a metallic jangle as keys were pulled from a pocket. Denri flattened herself against the wall by the door, squishing as far as she could behind a storage crate. The lock clicked and the door slid open.

Two boys walked in, their scrawny teenage forms shifting under the flickering light of a lamp.

"Everything looks fine. Let's get back to--."

"What's that on the wall? Bring the lantern up closer." The two boys stepped into the room. Denri inched towards the door behind them. Danzo really needed to teach his guards about looking in multiple directions.

One of the boys snorted in laughter as the light fell on Denri's drawing. But the other boy quickly elbowed him.

"Idiot. How do you think this got here? Someone must have snuck in!"

Denri was slipping through the doorway now, about to disappear down the hallway. But then an opportunity caught her attention.

The keys dangled in the lock, calling to Denri. These two kids were practically begging her to stir up a bit of mischief. She smiled.

Denri put her arm across her mouth and blew a loud, wet raspberry. It ripped through the silence like, well, like a loud fart in a quiet room. The two boys spun around, mouths hanging open like a pair of dumb monkeys. Denri couldn't have asked for more. She slammed the door shut and turned the lock.

By the time the two boys had processed what happened and run to the door, she had slipped the keys in her shirt and was halfway down the hallway. They started shouting and pounding against the door frame.

Denri chuckled as she pictured their dumbfounded expressions. It almost made up for the fact that she didn't get to go smashing through any paper walls.

Denri managed to duck back into the main hallway before another set of guards came from the direction where Denri had heard voices earlier. They went running in the direction of Denri's prisoners.

Denri turned, planning to head out the way she came. But before she could take a step, a sound caught her attention. It sounded like a child crying. The sobs were coming from the other hallway, where the latest batch of guards had come from. 

Denri's feet were moving before she'd fully processed the information. She poked her head around the corner to make sure the guards weren't looking behind them, then darted further into the compound.

After a couple twists and turns, Denri found herself peering around a corner into a large room with more hallways peeling off to the right and straight ahead. This area was more brightly lit, and there was a low table near the hallway to the right. It was covered in bottles of sake and playing cards.

On the far left wall, two individuals were chained to the floor. One was a middle aged man who had clearly lived a hard life. His short, thick black hair was streaked throughout with gray and his skin was leathery from sun exposure. Scars crisscrossed his arms and face.

Huddled between his arms, a young girl was crying, her tears muffled as she buried her face in the man's shirt. The girl's hair was in a long, sloppy braid down her back. She couldn't be older than ten.

Both of them wore dirty, tattered clothes and seemed dangerously thin.

Denri looked around the room. When she didn't see anyone else, she ran up to the pair. Up close, their features seemed different enough that Denri didn't think they were related. The man had a blocky jaw and large nose, while the girl was all delicate angles. But the man did have a _lot_ of scars. He could have looked like anything before.

"Hey, you two look like you could use a hand." 

The man eyed her warily, his arms tightening around the girl. But at the sound of Denri's voice, the girl sniffed in surprise. She squirmed and twisted in the man's arms until she faced out. Her eyes were big and brown, with floodgates ready to open again at a moment's notice. "Wh-who are you?"

"My name's Denri." Denri put on her most heroic smile. "I'm here to rescue you."

"But you're so small." The quavering voice convinced Denri to let that one slide.

"Size isn't everything. I already took care of a bunch of guards to make it here, you know." The girl's eyes went wide. "What's your name?"

The girl sniffed and wiped a trail of snot from her nose. "My name's Aki." She patted the man's arms encircling her. "This is Eizo."

There was a loud crash behind Denri, muffled by distance and walls. The guards must have decided to break through the locked door. Aki immediately started crying again. Eizo gave Denri a stern look.

"I thought you took care of the guards."

"I did! Sort of. Look, I'm just kind of winging it right now, OK? And doing a pretty good job of it considering I was asleep five minutes ago." Denri ignored Eizo's confused look and pulled out the ring of keys. She flipped through them, trying each on the locks. 

There were shouts and footsteps down the hallway. It sounded like the guards were checking with the sentries at the front. Not much time till they came this way. 

"Did they bring you all in a back door or something? I don't think the front is a viable option anymore."

Eizo nodded and pointed towards the hallway opposite the one Denri came through. "They brought us in through there."

"Great. Can you run?" Denri found the right key and slotted it into the manacles around Aki's legs.

"I think so."

"Can you carry her?" Chains clattered to the ground as Aki's wrists were freed. The girl stopped crying for the moment, rubbing her wrists appreciatively. 

"Yes." The set of the man's jaw suggested the answer would have been the same even if both his legs were broken.

"Great." Denri handed the key to the man and then grabbed Aki by the shoulders gently. She was only slightly taller than the child. "Hey. We're going to get out of here now, OK?" Aki nodded, sending a couple tears spilling down her cheeks. "While we're running, I need you to do something for me. No matter what happens, you have to stay quiet. Not a single peep until we're outside. Can you do that for me?"

The girl wiped her eyes on her sleeve and nodded.

"Perfect. Otherwise the bad guys won't be able to hear all my heroic jokes." Denri winked and earned a watery smile from Aki.

Eizo's chains clattered to the ground and he lifted Aki in his arms. The two of them looked pathetically thin. "What's the plan?"

"Step one is run. Step two is don't get caught." They took off for the back exit with the sound of boots stomping down the hallway behind them.
