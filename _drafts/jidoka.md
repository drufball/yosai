Fumi sat cross-legged on a low wall at the edge of a minor noble's yard. Her perpetually windblown hair was pulled back in a messy bun. Several strands of hair had already escaped. A fist-sized leather pouch was suspended between her palms, buffeted by the wind she used to keep it aloft. Fumi eyed the pouch curiously.

"Are you sure we can't open it?"

The pouch jerked from her hands and arced into Iruka's outstretched palm. The senior Dagger sat on the edge of their cart, legs kicking idly. "Absolutely not. The whole reason people bring us in is for secrecy. If they wanted a bunch of meatheads asking lots of questions, they would have hired Heroes."

"Please, don't trouble yourself." Moto pushed Iruka's leg aside as he finished loading the cart.

"It's not our fault you lost the bet! First one spotted by the guards." Fumi turned a pout back to Iruka. "A quick look isn't going to hurt anybody! All this fuss for a bag of jewels barely worth more than our contract fee. There must be something more."

Keta was leaning against the wall beside Fumi, his arms crossed. "Perhaps they are family heirlooms."

Moto hefted the last bag in place and turned to face the group. "I've never known a merchant to be sentimental. Not when coin is involved."

Keta's mouth dipped into a frown as Moto spoke. He was doing that a lot, lately. "There is a first time for everything. If we're ready to go..." The shapeling pushed himself off the wall and started walking down the street.

Iruka gave Moto a look, then scrambled to the front of the cart and set the horses moving. Moto fell in beside Fumi. The young woman was grumbling about unsatisfying endings to stories.

They walked down a wide, cobbled stone boulevard. Neatly manicured beech trees lined the street, shading walled yards on either side. Multi-story stone manors occupied the ends of those yards.

Each resident was locked in a struggle to outdo their neighbors. To the right was a steeply-arched dragon scale roof of such a bright blue it almost hurt to look at in the noonday sun. To the left was a garden teeming with workers fidgeting over details Moto would never comprehend.

Almost all those who walked the streets were shapelings dressed in brightly colored robes. The few humans who walked among them crouched forward to match the short stature of the shapelings.

Moto and the others received more than one disapproving glare as they made their way. The Daggers maintained a neutral stance, but Hisoka, Iga's Champion, was ultimately pledged to Tsukuyomi. And Tsukuyomi's followers belonged in Jidoka's slums, not within the walls of the High City.

Moto hunched his shoulders uncomfortably. With three humans, all dressed in the jet black of Daggers, there was no chance of blending in. They stood out like a cutpurse at a gala. He didn't like standing out.

Fumi bounced at his side, her head held high as she looked around. She could never hold onto a frustration for more than a minute or two. She gave a low whistle. "Here I thought some of the senior Daggers were rich. I'm glad you convinced us to take this mission. I'll be telling stories about all this wealth for years!"

Moto grunted distractedly, his eyes down to avoid insulting any nobles.

Fumi bent forward, shoving her face into Moto's field of view as they walked. "Hey! Are you listening?"

Moto waved a hand at her face but she darted out of the way and reappeared on his other side. She threw an arm around his shoulder. Moto surprised himself when he didn't pull away instinctively.

"Will you and Keta quit moping and make up already? It's hardly heroic."

Moto bristled. Fumi knew just how to get under his skin. "I'm not moping. And there's nothing to make up about! I'm not mad at Keta."

"Well, he's mad at you. Have you two talked about what happened to those soldiers in the cave?"

Moto turned his head away from Fumi. "There hasn't been a good time to bring it up."

"No? Not a single moment on the entire journey here? Two weeks from Iga to Jidoka, and you never had a moment to pull Keta aside?"

"He'll come to me when he wants to talk."

Fumi groaned. "I knew you were prickly, but I didn't know your were a fool too. You'll never feel the mountain breeze if you wait for the summit to climb itself."

She laughed as he pushed her away angrily. She left him to walk with his own thoughts.

The buildings became more plain as they approached the merchant's district clustered around Frost Gate. All of Jidoka's High City was wealthy, but the Military officers and merchants did not splurge on ostentation like the nobles did.

Moto lifted his gaze to Keta. He expected the shapeling to be as enthralled by the city as Fumi. The two of them were of a kind when it came to their love of spectacle. But the dancer's gaze remained forward.

Moto shook his head. He was used to keeping his distance. But space didn't seem to be making things any better. He hated to admit it, but maybe Fumi was right.

He pretended not to see Fumi's grin, or her thumbs up, as he trotted forward to Keta.

The shapeling looked over his shoulder as Moto neared. "Yes?"

"I-- uh-- I was thinking we should talk about what happened in the cave." Moto rubbed his hands along his pants nervously. "Are you still mad?"

Keta faced forward again. "I am not mad."

"Oh. It... seems like you're mad."

"Well, I am not. So you may rest easy."

Moto hesitated. He was good at reading people. But he had never really used the skill other than to manipulate. "I thought... well, you know what happened with the other prisoners. I'm sorry we couldn't save them."

"Yes, you have made it clear that that was not possible." Keta's tone was frosty.

There was a pause, long enough to be awkward. Moto was suddenly aware of how much Keta usually drove the conversations. He soldiered on. "I won't claim to know what was possible or not. But things were starting to look bad." Moto laid a tentative hand on Keta's shoulder. "I didn't want to risk you getting hurt." He paused again, uncomfortable with what he was saying. "Not for anything."

Keta shrugged his shoulder out from under Moto's hand. "Except the mission, of course. We could not risk that. Not even to save three men's lives."

Moto pulled his hand back like it had been stung. His face darkened. "When the spiders attacked, I threw myself on _you_, not the kid. And when you wanted to save the prisoners the first time, I helped even though I thought it was risky. So don't say I put the mission above you." He didn't mention how much that fact scared him.

"Fine. You care for me." Keta waved a hand angrily. "But what of those people? Do not try to say that you cared for their fate."

"What do you want from me?" Moto shook his hands angrily as he shouted.

"Hey! Keep it down rock heads. This is not the place for yelling." Iruka gestured to the surrounding neighborhood and the handful of people looking up at Moto's outburst.

Moto lowered his voice, stepping closer to Keta. "What do you want from me? There was too much going on and I prioritized. I cared about you, and the squad, and the kid. So I did what I thought gave those people the best chance of getting out. I didn't care about the other prisoners. I'm sorry. Would you rather I let you get hurt? Or the kid to die?"

"I would _rather_ you not seem so casual about condemning three men to death."

"I'm not going to torture myself when there was no other option. Sure, it sounds honorable to talk about saving everyone no matter the risk. But in the real world you can't have everything. And thinking you can will get people killed."

"Your way of thinking got people killed too."

"_More_ people. You know what I mean!" Moto ground his jaw, forcing his tone to soften. "Keta, I didn't want those people to die. If I thought there was reasonable chance of saving everyone, I would have tried. But I did what I thought was necessary to save the people I care about. Is that really so bad?"

"I do not think you are a bad person Moto. But when we met, I thought that the distance you put between yourself and others was a defense. I thought you were afraid of the pain that would come if you let yourself care too much. But now I fear that I was wrong. Perhaps, I do not want to be with someone who is so fatalistic about the evil and death in this world."

Moto stood with his mouth open, unsure how to respond. Keta's words hurt. Too much. "Fine, then I will not burden you with my presence."

Moto stomped back to the cart and pulled his pack free. "I am going to explore the city by myself for a while."

Iruka looked at him over her glasses, eyebrows raised. "Are you sure? This mission was your idea. You don't want to be there for contract completion?"

"No. I'll meet you at Frost Gate in the afternoon to leave." Moto cut down an alley and left them all behind.

<br />

"Watch it."

"No, _you_ watch it." Moto stared ice at the man he had just bumped. The man saw his jet black robes and quickly stepped back, nodding deferentially as he hurried away.

Moto knew it had been his own fault. Wrapped up in imaginary arguments with Keta, he hadn't been watching where he walked. But he was in a foul mood and didn't feel like controlling himself.

Moto was already worried about how his feelings for Keta might affect his drive to achieve his ambitions. But now the shapeling was berating him for those feelings as well? Keta was always saying he was too cold. But now loving him was the wrong answer too?

Moto nearly missed a step at that last thought. Those kind of feelings were dangerous. He was just overreacting. Feeling sentimental after Keta's harsh words. But his chest burned when he thought of Keta saying he didn't want to be with him.

Moto brushed his thoughts aside angrily as he rummaged in his pouch and pulled out the rubbing he had taken of their last contract. The one Sounstealer tried to hide. At the bottom of the contract were two hands in the middle of an exchange, one holding a coin and the other holding a mask.

It was the sigil of the merchant who had given the contract. Moto had pushed for their current mission to Jidoka so he could investigate further.

The merchant's office was likely in the High City, but if there was anything to find, Moto wasn't going to get to it by talking to the merchant directly. They'd be ready with some well-practiced lie. And then Soundstealer might know Moto was poking around.

If there was anything to hide, something wouldn't add up in the day to day business. So Moto wanted to talk to the merchant's workers, poke around the warehouses. And that meant a trip to the Icepacker's Ward.

Jidoka surrounded Sanshimai, a massive lake who's shore was cut by three rivers. Each area served a different function for the city. Hundreds of years before, each district had been a distinct domain, but Sadashi had conquered the other two cities and folded them into his own.

Covering the north and west shores, High City - with it's stone wall, fancy manors, and military training grounds - was the original seat of Sadashi's power. To the east were the Pleasure Gardens. Sakuya's former domain was now a luxury district with tame bamboo groves, tea shops, and any other service a wealthy Jidokan desired.

On the south shore of the lake, the Icepacker's Ward had suffered the most under Sadashi. Once obsessed with art and stories, the former Tsukuyomi domain had been turned into Jidoka's slums. The once-thriving town was littered theatres and art studios converted to icehouses for processing High City's favorite lake fish. Still more served as cramped living quarters for the many gangs and beggars who didn't work the lake.

Moto approached a woman playing the harp on a street corner. The hat placed at her feet for coins was empty. Her ragged clothes and scrawny limbs suggested this was a regular occurrence. He pulled out a copper coin and tossed it into the hat, keeping a tight grip on the rest of his coin purse. He knew how these operations usually worked.

"Another if you can tell me which tavern I can go to to talk to some of the workers here."

The woman laughed, but cut the sound off quickly at Moto's glower. "Any tavern sir... there's not much in Kumadori that isn't given over to feeding the brutes behind those walls."

Kumadori was the old name for the town, before it had been conquered. Moto took another look at the woman's harp. It was old, the painted wood was chipped and faded, but it had been a fine instrument once. Moto guessed this woman's ancestors had been important before Sadashi took over.

He pulled out a pair of silvers, stepping closer to the woman and dropping his voice conspiratorially. "I feel I can trust someone who treats an instrument fine as that with such care. I'm looking for someone who's gotten a little too cozy with the lords and ladies behind the wall. These are yours if you can show me the place I'm looking for."

The woman nodded approvingly as he spoke, but mostly she eyed the two silvers hungrily. She nodded and snatched them out of his hands. "What are you looking for?"

Moto held out the contract, folded so only the sigil showed. "Have you seen this sigil before? I'm looking for a man who works in the warehouses for this merchant."

The woman made a show of squinting at the paper for a good while. Moto thought she was going to act as though a few more coins might jog her memory, until he saw her gesturing with the fingers by her side. He didn't need to look around to know some greasy looking cutthroat was standing in a nearby alley drawing his daggers and getting ready to follow. Moto grabbed her wrist.

"Perhaps I should be dealing with your friend, then, if you feel the need to call them along?" Moto pulled on the silver coins in her hand, harder than he needed to. They snapped out of her grasp and flew back into his palm.

The woman's eyes widened. "No sir. I-- sorry sir." She did not look at all chastened to have been caught, but Moto thought she wouldn't try anything now that she knew he had a resonance. He held the two silvers back out to her.

"As long as we're understood. Save the blades for your real enemies. Or at least a softer mark. Now, have you seen the sigil?"

"I've seen it. I don't know the name of who owns it, or anything much besides. But I've seen a warehouse that bears the mark."

The woman led him through the muddy streets of the Icepacker's Ward, working their way towards Sanshimai. She grumbled when he refused to take the dark, narrow alleys she claimed were shortcuts. The smell of fish grew until it was nearly overwhelming by the time they reached a two story building spanning an entire block on the lake's shore. The merchant's mark stood above the wide doors at the front.

Moto drew out another silver coin and offered it to the woman.

"What's this for?" She snatched the coin without waiting for an answer.

"To forget you ever saw me."

She nodded, spinning on her heel and disappearing down an alley without another word. Moto turned his attention back to the warehouse and settled on a barrel to watch.

At first, he was disappointed. The workers who came and went seemed ordinary enough. A muscular pair hauled baskets full of silver fish from the docks to a set of tables outside the front door, where a line of dour faced men and women with blood stained hands and aprons gutted the fish. Small children ran up and down the line, grabbing finished cuts and ferrying them into the warehouse. A man, back hunched with age so that his long beard nearly touched his knees, sat outside a small three sided shed, smoking some of the catch.

The more Moto watched, the more questions he had. Hadn't this merchant relocated to Jidoka recently? The son they rescued was supposedly following soon behind the father. So how did he already have such a large operation? Perhaps the merchant had purchased the business from someone else. But the sigil over the doors did not look freshly painted. And while the area around the workshop was bustling with activity, there were not nearly as many people as he would have expected given the size of the workshop.

A pair of dangerous looking women approached the front of the warehouse and greeted the people gutting the fish, laughing as someone cracked a joke. The kids running up and down the line gave the women a wide birth, as though they had suffered a few kicks for getting too close in the past. After a few moments, the two women carried on to the side of the building, looking up and down the street before they slipped into an alley.

It didn't take much thought to know he wanted to follow those women. Moto ducked into an alley of his own and pulled himself to a nearby rooftop, then slinked to the edge of the alley the women had taken and peered over the edge.

The alleyway below was empty. Moto didn't think he was far enough behind the women that they could have made it to the other end and out of sight. That left the plain door set into the back half of the side wall. Moto dropped to his stomach and waited.

The women might be nothing more than warehouse guards. Or even a pair of local thugs hired to shake down the surrounding neighborhood for an extra bit of cash. Moto didn't really care if the merchant had a heart of gold or not. He wanted to know if they had any interests besides their main business. Interests that might have brought them into conflict with Moto's village.

A half hour passed and Moto saw three more armed individuals, two women and one man, enter through the warehouse's side door. Not necessarily normal, but not altogether suspicious either. If Moto wasn't curious about this merchant specifically, he wouldn't have looked twice. But it was enough of a curiosity that he wanted to know more.

He pulled back from the ledge and rose into a squat. The alley was no more than a pace or two wide. Getting to the warehouse roof was trivial. As was slipping through one of the narrow windows toward the top of the wall.

Inside, the building was a single story. Crates were stacked near to the top of the double height ceilings, forming wide corridors. Wooden cranes were placed on sliders nearby for loading and unloading. The room was cold, probably from the ice used to pack the fish. To Moto's left, a solid wall divided the building in half. To his right, in the far back corner, a set of stairs led to an enclosed office, standing on stilts halfway up to the ceiling.

Moto pulled himself up to the building's shadowed rafters, moving in quick bursts and otherwise holding still to avoid drawing any eyes. None of the crates came near the windows at the top of the building. If not for his resonance, sneaking in through the roof would not have been so simple. But still, it felt too easy. Maybe they didn't have much to hide.

Moto looked around as his eyes adjusted. The warehouse floors were clean and dry. Moto would have expected more mess for a building whose purpose was to hold ice and dead fish. Now that he looked, he couldn't see anywhere that suggested fish or ice packing. Perhaps this was the equipment room, and the fish were stored in the other half of the warehouse? When he scanned the wall dividing the building, he saw there were no doors connecting this side to the other.

Along with the five people he had seen enter, there was only one other person in the room. The six of them were down one of the hallways outlined by crates. Four of them were loading open boxes while the other two were hooking a closed one on to a crane. Moto moved closer to get a look.

Weapons. The three crates being loaded were neatly packed with swords, arrows, and other armaments. The men and women were working with a practiced efficiency that suggested they had loaded many such boxes.

Moto pulled back into the shadows and thought. These people were obviously up to something. If even half the boxes in this room were filled the same way as those he had just seen, this warehouse could outfit a small militia. But what for?

Was someone planning an uprising in the Icepacker's Ward? Moto dismissed the idea. There was no way someone would have access to this many weapons without also having better security. Only six people, all working with no one on guard. Unlocked windows, and a warehouse split in half with no door between. This place wouldn't hold up to even the barest amount of scrutiny. A couple hours from him had already found this much.

Whatever this was, they had to be connected to the government somehow. That was the best explanation for why they seemed to care so little about being discovered. But there was _some_ attempt being made to hide things. So it was unofficial in some capacity. Moto saw two likely explanations.

Someone in Jidoka, someone with enough clout to cover if the city guard ever found this warehouse, was planning a move against the other lords. Or Sadashi had some plans that he didn't want being seen and leaking out of the city. Based on how the boxes were packed, Moto's best guess was the former. Each crate had a wide variety of weapons. If it was some central government work, he would expect the crates to be more systematically loaded. All swords or all bows, not a mix.

Either way, this merchant was involved in something bigger. Moto slipped through the rafters again, using his power to fly through the beams without making a sound. It was hard to imagine how he had ever managed to go unseen without it. He came to rest against the wall of the enclosed office on the opposite side of the warehouse thugs. The wall was smooth, but Moto clung with ease.

Moto peered through the small window on the side of the office. It looked plain enough. A simple table stood by the door, littered with paper and writing instruments. Beside the table were a few boxes filled with records. At the center of the room was a man with hands and feet bound to a chair and mouth gagged. His clothes were ragged and his face was badly bruised. The man's chin rested against his chest, unconscious.

Moto hesitated. Should he try to wake the prisoner up? They might have useful information. But they would probably make a scene if he didn't help them escape, which Moto wasn't planning to do. He didn't want the merchant or Soundstealer knowing that anyone was investigating them. And in his foul mood after the argument with Keta, Moto wasn't feeling particularly charitable.

Keeping an eye on the prisoner, Moto eased into the room. He pulled against the ceiling weakly to keep his footsteps light and tip-toed toward the box of records. He slid his fingers along the labeled dividers sticking out of the box, wondering what to look for. What might tell him whether this merchant had been the one who hired Soundstealer to destroy Moto's village?

Records of business interests near his home village would be a start. He scanned to a section of shipping records, then pulled out a few sheets and slid them into his robes.

What about motivation? Maybe the Hero who founded Moto's village was raiding this merchant for supplies. Or the hideout was on some valuable resources. Moto found the section on money transactions and started flipping back through the years. He quickly realized, though, that the financial records in this office were only for shipments made from here. Not what he was looking for. But he was interested to find that the records went back far longer than they should for a merchant new to the city.

The man at the center of the room groaned as he started to wake. Moto spun, racing towards the window without hesitation. But he was only halfway through the room when the prisoner's eyes came open. In the moment it took him to process what he was seeing, Moto had reached the window. The man began grumble and moan, unable to do more through the gag in his mouth. There was pleading in his voice and the whites showed around his eyes.

Moto held a finger to his lips, trying to shush the man, but he kept making noise. He slid his chair towards the window in desperation. Moto cursed under his breath, then through one leg over the windowsill. He'd just have to run and hope this guy didn't draw the workers too fast. When he saw Moto was leaving, the man gave another frantic cry and managed to tip the chair sideways in a loud thud.

"Did you hear that?"

"Sounds like the fox friend is awake again. Who wants to take the next turn?" There was a groan from whoever was selected.

Moto slipped out of the window and clung beneath the ledge. He wanted to keep running, but he needed to see what the prisoner did first. The man had gotten a good look at Moto's face. If he told the guard and gave a description, he might need to do something about both of them.

The door to the office opened and Moto heard heavy footsteps enter. One of the men. "What did we say about making such a ruckus? Makin' more work for us." There was a grunt as the prisoners chair was righted. Then a soft thud paired with a pained grunt from the prisoner. "Next time I won't go so easy. Are we clear? Now, since you're awake, let's hear if you've decided to be any more cooperative."

The prisoner gasped as his gag was removed. Moto tensed, was the prisoner going to say anything about him? He pulled a dagger off his belt and got ready to move if necessary.

"Where is your boss hiding?"

"I've already told you, we haven't seen him in years! Tamer abandoned us as soon as he made it into the Sanyaku."

"I'm getting tired of playing these games. Those beasts knew exactly where and when to strike. Somebody let him know that shipment was coming. If you keep trying to take us for a bunch of fools, maybe we outta just go get someone who's going to be more cooperative..."

"Please, I swear by the Nine Tails that I'm telling you the truth."

"That doesn't mean squat."

"Well it does to me." A hint of defiance entered the man's voice. "Just because you've let Jidoka buy your loyalty, doesn't mean I have."

There was a loud slap. "I told you any more of that high and mighty crap about loyalty to the White Fox and I'd slap you across the face. You watch your tongue."

No wonder the prisoner's face was such a mess, provoking the guard like that. Why be such an idiot? Moto paused. The prisoner had seen Moto's clothes. Maybe he recognized him as a Dagger and was hoping Moto would help if he knew the prisoner was still loyal to Tsukuyomi.

Moto shook his head. If that was his goal, the man was barking up the wrong tree. Either way, if the man was going to tell the guard about Moto, he probably would have by now. He might say something later, but that risk seemed less now than leaving bodies that would certainly be found. Moto eased passed the window, moving slowly towards the rafters to avoid making any sounds.

The interrogator let out a theatrical sigh. "Fine, if you're not going to be any more cooperative then we'll just find another. Maybe this time we won't bother being covert. It's not too hard wiping out a tiny village like yours, you know."

Moto paused, his attention suddenly caught.

"Wait, please!" The prisoner sounded worried now. "We haven't done anything against you. You have to believe me. We don't want anything to do with Tamer. We just want to be left alone."

"The way I see it, you're all tainted whether you're working with Tamer or not. You chose to follow him at some point. And I guess we'll know the truth of whether you still do once we've wiped the rest of you off the map. We'll see if Tamer keeps striking half so accurate."

"Please! There are kids up there. Families. My family. Don't you think I would tell you anything if I could?"

"Well, we'll take a few alive for questioning. Maybe you'll get lucky and--."

Another dagger was in Moto's hand before he realized he had even thrown the first one. The interrogator took the blade at the base of the neck near his collarbone and stumbled sideways. His hand reached to the wound as his eyes widened in fear. He tried to scream but only managed a wet gurgle. The man fell heavily into the writing table, knocking it over with a crash.

One of the women shouted from the warehouse below. "Everything OK up there, Bako?"

Bako was dragging himself up the wall, blood-covered fingers leaving streaks on the wall. He raised his fist towards the window. Moto buried another dagger in the man's back, but it was too late. He brought his hand down and shattered the glass.

"Hey! What's going on up there?"

Moto berated himself as he slipped back through the window. Stupid. Losing his temper like that. Was he some kind of stupid kid? He ran up to Bako and pulled his knives free as the man's lifeless body slid down amidst the shattered glass.

"Thank you! I knew you were a follower of Tsukuyomi when I saw the--."

"Shutup!" Moto's voice was nearly a hiss. "Are you trying to let the whole lot of them know who I am? It's bad enough you got me dragged into this." Moto walked over to the man and quickly slashed through the ropes at his hands and feet. "Can you get yourself out of here?"

The man stood unsteadily. Moto wondered if he should just kill the man and run. Just because he'd lost his temper didn't mean he needed to keep digging the whole deeper. He lifted his blade thoughtfully.

The door burst open and Moto turned, throwing both daggers. One buried itself in a woman's forehead, but the woman behind managed to duck beneath the second. Her eyes widened as she saw the scene. "Daggers! It's the fox lovin' Daggers!"

Moto braced his own stance and pulled on the woman hard. She came stumbling forward, caught completely off balance. He buried another knife in her stomach right as the one that had sailed passed her came careening back, burying itself at the base of her neck.

Moto's face was nearly a snarl as he turned to the prisoner. "I got you untied and I'll deal with these goons. In exchange, you never saw me. You managed to cut your ropes and take them all by surprise. Got it?"

"But, if they think I did all this they'll come after my--."

"Do I look like I'm in a mood to negotiate?" Moto shouted at the man, voice laced with venom. Things were already way out of hand. This man did not realize his life rested on a knife's edge. Moto's knife.

The man took one look at Moto's hands, dripping blood, and nodded queasily. "Good, now get yourself out of here."

Moto launched through the doorway in time to see a man and a woman racing up the bottom of the stairs with swords drawn. The last man was running towards the exit. Moto pulled on the ceiling as he flipped over the two people on the stairs. He landed on top of the crates and set off running towards the fleeing man. He couldn't let one of them escape.

A gout of flame arced over his shoulder. Moto turned as the man on the stairs shot another blast, but the woman grabbed his wrist and pulled it wide.

"Idiot! Are you trying to light the crates on fire? We don't know what's packed in that column!"

Moto turned back towards the exit, but the man was nearly there. Moto took two big, arcing leaps, pulling on the crates to increase his speed. At this rate he wasn't going to catch him. Maybe he could block his way.

Moto pulled himself into the rafters, then turned and pulled on the crates behind him. The wooden beams under his feet groaned from the strain, but they held long enough for the tower of crates to topple. They crashed forward into the next row. And the next. Until a chain reaction was crashing towards the door.

There was a concussive shock, followed by a wave of heat as one of the columns of crates exploded on impact. A few more rows fell and then another column detonated. Moto stared on, mouth hanging open. They were storing more than just simple weapons, it seemed.

Moto's plan worked and the crates dominoed all the way to the door, crashing and splintering into a heap of rubble that blocked the door. But the fires from the crates were spreading, and every third or fourth column of crates seemed to hold more explosives. He needed to get out of here.

Moto heard cries of alarm and looked back. A set of crates had exploded near the office. The resonant who had shot fire at Moto lay unmoving, an arm length shard of wood impaled through his stomach. The remaining guard and the prisoner were both trapped behind a wall of flame.

There was no time to go back and help. Even if he could get the man out of here safely, it would take too long. With the noise and fire, guards would be here in no time. Moto turned and ran through the rafters, launching through a window and onto the roof of a nearby building.

He went a block before dropping back to the ground.

"Moto?"

Moto turned, dagger leaping into his hand. Standing at the end of the alley, flames dancing in his large, dark eyes, was Keta.
