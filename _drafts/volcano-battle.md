Denri woke with a start as her mind clawed it's way free from a deep sleep of exhaustion. The ceiling's polished steel plates had a sulky red sheen, reflecting torchlight from somewhere. Where was she? Denri rolled onto her side and looked around the room.

Her head throbbed as she moved. It felt like a horse had methodically stomped across her, taking care to bruise every inch. Three long lines along her arm, back, and hip, burned more sharply. Her right leg didn't move quite right. A flood of memories returned with the pain.

Discovered as they infiltrated Shinmon's workshop. Fleeing into the streets. Cornered by the Arbiters. Fighting. They had almost escaped.

Until that man appeared like a flash of lightning. Denri groaned. Not _like_ a flash of lightning. An actual flash of lightning. She could still see his grin as his form emerged from the searing flash of energy.

A man cleared his throat impatiently, drawing Denri's attention. He wrapped the back of his gauntlet against the bars again. "Get up. The Twins have summoned you."

Denri pushed to a sitting position, forcing herself not to wince as the man looked on. "Where is my friend?"

"She has been summoned as well." Aki was alive. And they had learned a lot from Shinmon's workshop. Once they took a look through his notebook, they would know even more.

Her head shot around. Besides the bed, her cell was empty. No sign of the research they had stolen, or the jacket where she had stuffed Sadashi's ring and the mysterious white stone. She reached to the back of her belt and found her pouch and weapons gone too.

"You're belongings have been confiscated." The man placed a hand on the pommel of his sword. "I will not ask you to move again."

"Alright, alright." Denri rose slowly and limped to the door. Her right leg was in a hasty splint. "I can work with this."

They were making progress. The situation looked bad, but she had been in tight spots before. At least this time it was of their own doing, to achieve their own goal, instead of running blindly from Sadashi. She was through letting him call the shots.

If they planned on killing her and Aki, they would have already done it. That meant there would be a chance for them to escape. And retrieve the research. As long as they were ready to act. Whatever came, she would face it running forward. She smiled.

The guard led her down a long hallway. His boots rang against the steal floor, loud compared to Denri's bare feet. The entire hallway was made of burnished steel, reflecting the flickering torchlight from every direction. Floor, ceiling, walls, all covered in countless wavering red eyes. Denri stuck her tongue out at them, earning a sidelong glance from the guard.

Castle Six - Denri couldn't imagine anywhere else this place could be - was spartan. A few recessed alcoves held stone statues and ornate contraptions that seemed to have no purpose other than to be complicated. But even these were rare. And there was nothing that could burn.

"Hoping there's no Castle Seven, eh?" The guard did not respond.

Every hallway looked the same as they worked their way up the levels. The floors were connected by wide ramps, also identical, instead of stairways. By the time they reached the Twins, Denri was completely lost. The guard shoved her through a set of wide double doors that closed quickly behind her.

It was the biggest room Denri had ever been in. The ceilings soared 30 feet overhead. It was so wide she could have rigged a sail in the time it took to walk the perimeter. Glass windows filled the two side walls from floor to ceiling, casting light on worktables filled with tools and half finished designs.

At the far end of the room were two high backed steel chairs. Denri couldn't imagine how two men with the same blocky faces could look more different.

One sat stiff-backed in flowing red and gold robes. His long, black hair was brushed to a shine and fell over his shoulder in a ponytail. A sword, covered in gears and levers, lay across his lap.

The other sat cross-legged, hunched over a book. He was wearing fitted worker's clothes covered in belts and pouches. His short, tangled hair was held back by a pair of goggles with too many lenses. The arm that turned the pages of the book was mechanical. It was the man who had appeared from the lightning the day before.

Fidgeting in front of them, looking small in such a large room, was Aki. Denri limped over and punched the young girl's hip. She looked down, showing a bruised cheek and a busted lip. Added to the heavy white scar where her right eye used to be, the girl struck a fearsome image. Denri was glad to see that Aki looked more antsy than fearful.

The fancy twin cleared his throat. "Good. Now that you are both here, we may begin. I know of your name from the bounty report. Denri. And what is your name?"

"Aki." Her voice was respectful, but she met the man's eyes as she spoke.

"Very well. Denri and Aki. Do you care to explain why--"

"Usually, it's polite to offer your name in return." Denri crossed her arms, doing her best not to wince as her hand came to rest on the not-quite-scabbed sword slash along her bicep. She wouldn't let them control the conversation. No one was going to choose her course for her anymore.

The man with the book in his lap loosed a cackle that pushed the boundaries of sanity. He didn't look up from the book as he spoke. "She's got a point, Man." His head cocked a fraction to the side. "What! I wasn't even talking. You always take his side." A pause. "Fine." He glanced up at Denri. "Hideki. Happy?" He returned to his book.

Both Denri and Aki stared blankly. The more formal twin waited to see if the crazy one had anything else to say before proceeding. "I am Manabu. My brother's name is Hideki, in case that wasn't clear. Now, if you wouldn't mind, explain yourselves. Why are you in Sky Furnace?" Manabu's tone made it clear he didn't care whether Denri minded explaining or not.

"We're here to buy equipment."

"Is that so? Explain to me, then, why my brother found you carrying a ring with the personal seal of Sadashi. Surely, he is able to provide all of the equipment needed for your journeys?"

Denri almost laughed. Was that why they were still alive? After all this, would Sadashi provide their way out? "Our supplies needed to be replenished. We did not want or intend to cause any problems in your domain. If your Arbiters had not accosted us, we would have left quietly. We still can. Unless you plan to anger the Warlord..."

Manabu steepled his fingers and leaned forward. "I have no doubt that you are powerful. Your bounty, and the squad of Arbiters who can barely stand this morning, attest to that. But do not overestimate your position. The book my brother holds, the book he took from you, contains detailed notes on our castle, along with information about some of our most _closely guarded_ research. You are spies. Sadashi's protection or no, you will face the consequences. If you have any hope of leaving this room alive, you will tell us everything you know. Who in Sky Furnace gathered this information? What are Sadashi's plans?"

Denri blinked. This path wasn't going to work. Apparently the book contained more information than she thought. If only they could get a look at it. She threw her hands in the air. "Alright, I was lying. We don't work for Sadashi. I only said that hoping you would let us go. But there _are_ spies in Sky Furnace. It just so happens we were hunting them for our own reasons. We infiltrated their lab last night and stole the ring and that book, which is why we have them. We're not spies. Neither of us had any experience with Sky Furnace before this week."

"A convenient change of tact. Yet the Arbiters you fought say that you had an ally. Someone who helped you escape before Hideki intervened. How is it that you have no experience with our city, yet an ally willing to risk their life for you?"

"That was the person who we stole the book from." Denri pointed at the book in Hideki's hands. "You've read that thing. The _worst_ place for it to end up would be in your hands. Better for us to escape with it."

Hideki slapped the side of his face and inhaled loudly. "These figures! Man, if these are real, it's just the data we've been missing!" There was a blinding flash of light and an earsplitting _crack_. When Denri opened her eyes, Hideki was crouched over a table, haphazardly shoving things off with one hand as he continued reading the book with the other.

Manabu ignored him, though Denri thought she saw his eyes trailing over to his brother with interest. "Why should I trust anything you say?"

"You don't have to trust us." Denri wracked her brain, straining for details that might convince him. "We were hunting two men. Shinmon and Yotogi. I overheard them talking and Yotogi said you had been suspicious of him since the Dragon's Roar. You were right. If you send Arbiters to Shinmon's lab, you'll see it was just broken into. I blew out one of the windows. Why would I have made that kind of ruckus if I was working with him?"

Manabu's eyes narrowed at the mention of Yotogi. He thought for a long moment before responding. "Very well. We will send a patrol to Shinmon. If things are as you say, we will discuss further. Even if you are not spies, though, I would know why you are pursuing this information."

Before Denri could answer, there was a loud _whoomph_ from Hideki's direction. He was standing with both hands, one gloved and one mechanical, on either side of a metal sphere. Trails of energy arced off of the sphere into Hideki's hands. He threw his head back and laughed in triumph.

Manabu stood, Denri and Aki completely forgotten. "You've got it working! How?" Manabu strode past them, peering over Hideki's shoulder. Standing as they were, their similarities suddenly became more apparent.

"The book! It's got data on _living trials_. They've exposed people to the Stone. No more guessing at the parameters."

"You can't be serious!" Manabu's eyebrows flew up in surprise. The expression was quickly suppressed. "Amaterasu has never allowed such a thing... How could they...? Which one provided access?"

Denri was fairly certain she shouldn't be hearing what the Twins were saying. But they were completely absorbed in the orb and the book. Manabu looked at the pages like a pile of precious gems.

They needed that information. Even if it didn't have clues on how to use Aki's abilities - which it clearly seemed to - the book had the locations of Aki's siblings. All those kids being experimented on. But at this point, the Twins were never going to give it up. Even if they ended up believing Aki and Denri weren't spies, the best they could hope for is to be sent away empty handed.

She could challenge them. They were Champions, after all. But she and Aki were in no condition to fight. And Eizo said her bounty was now close to the Sanyaku, the twelve strongest people in the Tournament. On the level of Champions just like the Twins. However hard the trial would be, she doubted they were ready for it. Sadashi's plan had worked, they had no options.

That decided her. "Screw it. Screw Sadashi if he thinks he's so smart."

Aki looked to Denri. "What are you saying?"

"Kid, remember how you healed Hattori? Could you heal me too?"

"I don't know. I think so. Do you want me to try?" She reached a hand out uncertainly.

"Good enough." Denri raised her voice so the Twins could hear. "Hey, you two! Remember us?" The Twins looked back to them reluctantly. "I'm glad you found the book useful. Whatever info you found, you're welcome to copy it down. But we stole that book fair and, uh-- fair and square. I want it back."

"You are in no position to make demands, girl. We haven't even confirmed your story about Shinmon. And even once we do--."

"Save it, buddy. I know exactly what position we're in. We haven't broken any of your laws and we're Tournament competitors. You can't mess with us until you've given us a challenge. I'm not making demands, I'm talking stakes."

"Don't be preposterous. This is not the time to be talking about Tournament challenges."

"That's my decision--." Aki cleared her throat behind Denri. "Sorry. That's _our_ decision, not yours. We challenge you. Winner keeps the book." Manabu continued to hesitate and Denri pressed on. "Don't tell me you're afraid of a couple injured rookies?"

Manabu's mouth hung open. He clearly was not used to being talked to in this way. Hideki nearly dropped the glowing orb he laughed so hard. "Look at his face! Oh, farmer, please tell me you were watching and not messing with manure again. Come look now!"

Manabu's jaw clicked shut, his teeth grinding. "Very well. If you're so set on dying. We accept."

<br />

<br />
<br />

They stood at Kazora's summit. Lava roiled below, blasting them with heat and casting everything in a red hue. Black, jagged rock stretched in a ring to surround the molten pool. A thick, sulfurous haze hung in the air, distorting the shapes of Sky Furnace's zeppelins above.

Denri was surprised to find that the rim of the volcano was so large. At it's thinnest, the ring was as wide as three streets. In many places, it opened out into wide plateaus, with ragged pillars and hills of stone.

"Well, at least no one can say we died a boring death."

Aki laughed weakly.

Denri stepped from foot to foot. Even with her boots returned, the ground was nearly too hot to stand in place comfortably. The Twins stood across from her, unimpressed by the heat or haze. The pit of deadly lava to their right might as well have been a mid-sized lake.

Manabu stepped forward and Denri dropped into a crouch instinctively. He gave her a dismissive look. "Cute. But I will not be fighting you myself."

Denri threw her best condescending smirk back at him. "Trying to flee from the challenge already?" Hideki chuckled behind his brother.

"Far from it. You set the stakes and I choose the challenge. If you insist on continuing with this foolishness, then I will at least pick something entertaining. One of our patrols tells me that your friend has a fondness for dragons..."

Manabu held out his arm, palm flat and facing towards the sky. A small flame appeared and began to pulse. With each pulse the ground shook. The lava below began to distort, rising up in a dome.

"Let's see how she feels once she's come face to face with--."

Denri groaned. "Really? Don't you think that's a little _too_ on the nose? Fighting a dragon on the rim of a volcano. Not particularly creative."

Manabu stood with his mouth open, the flame stuttered above his hand. Hideki's chuckle erupted into full blown laughter as he bent forward and grabbed his stomach. "This one! I like her. I hope she wins."

Manabu clenched his hand into a fist around the flame, sending jets of fire shooting between his fingers. He turned and stalked back to his brother with wounded dignity. "She has challenged you too, brother."

Manabu turned, placing a hand on his twin's shoulder. The cloth beneath his grip began to smoke, then ignited. Hideki yelped, jumping to the side as he batted out the flames. The side of Manabu's mouth quirked up as he spoke.

"Your challenge is to defeat Tetsujin. I doubt you will be joking for long."

Denri's small triumph faded quickly as she turned to stare at the swell of lava. Butterflies filled her stomach. She ran through the mental exercises Eizo had taught her, forcing herself to breath. The sulfur made her cough.

Aki was staring into the lava, entranced. She looked excited, not scared.

"Hey! On alert. Don't forget the Twins control him."

Aki grunted absently and Denri rapped the back of her head. "Ow! What was that for?"

"You're _smiling_! That dragon is going to try and kill us, Aki. Whatever you think, this one is not a friend. Now quit gawking and heal me before things get crazy."

"Oh! Right." Aki grabbed Denri's wrist, her face screwed up in concentration. There was a terrifying moment when nothing happened, and then Denri's mind went blank. A rush of memories and emotions filled the space. Some she recognized, others she did not. They rushed past too quickly to hang onto any one in particular.

A connection blossomed at the back of her mind. A seed that she realized had been there for some time, suddenly bursting forth into life. She could always read Aki's emotions. But now she could feel her. An active, conscious force resting within her.

Thought and vision returned. Denri stood in the same place as before, though she stood straighter and no longer favored her right leg. She felt energized. Strong and whole again. Better than whole. She clenched her fist and sparks jittered across her knuckles, dancing up her arm.

There was a thrill of relief inside her head. She could feel Aki's emotions with absolute clarity now. She turned to the girl and smiled. "You ready to do this?"

Aki's left eye, the one not covered in scar tissue, was closed in concentration. When she opened it, it was a bright, glowing blue. Just like Denri's. She nodded and they both turned towards the lava as it erupted.

Tetsujin was larger than Denri remembered. His head was wider than a cart, surrounded by a mane of gleaming iron that flowed like hair. Large whiskers tested the air before him. It was four stories from Kazora's rim to the lava below, but Tetsujin's face was nearly level with them by the time his tail finally emerged.

Denri's grin widened as the dragon swam through the sky. Her nerves turned to excitement and Eizo's lessons faded from her mind. She began to fidget. The air around her popped and cracked with flashes of electricity. She knew she should be scared, but all she wanted was to _move_.

"Are these the toys you've brought me, lords?" Tetsujin's voice boomed through the air, shaking Denri's bones.

Denri threw her head back and laughed. Her fingers itched. She could hardly remember being fearful. All the thoughts of risks and moving carefully had only been weighing her down. Her body felt like it was already filled with lightning. She said a thanks to the Stormbringer.

"Let's see what you can do." Denri charged her legs and shot forward.

Tetsujin loosed a jet of silver flame, but it seemed to crawl through the air. Denri dove to the side, rolling and springing back to her feet. She moved faster. Lightning trailed from her legs as she threw herself into the air. Tetsujin lashed out with his metallic talons. Denri was already gone.

She reappeared in a flash of light, shifting behind him. "Over here!" She brought her fists down in a double hammer strike against the back of his head.

She might as well have punched solid iron. Her body rang with the backlash of the blow. Tetsujin's tail whipped forward and she barely raised her arm in time to absorb the impact. Her bones and muscles creaked as the blow knocked her from the dragon's neck.

She twisted in the air, landing on her feet against the inside wall of the rim. Vaguely, she thought a blow like that should have broken her arm. Jumping from a window the day before had broken a leg.

"Is that all you've got?"

She surged forward, running along the wall as she drew the metal rods from her belt and launched them at the dragon. He hardly noticed as they bounced from his hide, shooting another jet of flame that Denri outran.

She could feel the charge in the air around her. She could change it. No need to send a bolt of lightning to pull the rods back. She reached out and grabbed them directly, set them dancing through the air around Tetsujin's head to distract him.

She leapt at his face again, calling the rods to her hands at the last minute. His hide was strong, but how about his eyes?

"Denri!" Aki's call was joined by a flare of disapproval in the back of her head, strong enough to pull her attention towards the girl. It felt like waking suddenly from a dream.

Her body lurched as Tetsujin's tail caught her in midair, sending her flying into the wall. The stone cracked around her, but somehow her body held.

"Don't hurt him! It's not his fault he has to fight."

Tetsujin's laugh was like a thousand dry logs crackling in a fire. "You think I need protection, girl?" He lunged towards her.

Aki waited with square shoulders and arms outstretched as Tetsujin approached. She kept her feet planted as the beast's opened wide.

At the last moment, Denri's connection with Aki flared and their thoughts were one. Fear and determination warred as Aki stepped forward, faster than normal. She dipped her shoulder beneath Tetsujin's onrushing jaw and her legs tensed as they threw her body against the dragon's chin.

Tetsujin's head changed course as though he had collided with the mountain itself. He loosed a grunt of surprise as he crashed into a massive pillar of stone that collapsed around him, momentarily holding him in place.

Aki stumbled, limbs suddenly looking slow and heavy once more. But she caught herself and pounced towards the dragon, body reshaping into the form of a large cat. She leapt onto Tetsujin's neck and her paws began to glow. The dragon thrashed harder to free itself and Aki dug in with her claws. There was a flash of bluish white.

There was a laugh like hungry flame. "I am not so easily cowed. It took Amaterasu herself to bind me, girl."

A jet of silver flame burst from the rubble around Tetsujin's head. Aki's cat form shrank, the fire passing through the space her body just occupied as the girl sprouted wings and took flight as a crow. Another blast of flame shot from the rock and Aki just barely dodged it. Focused on the flames, Aki didn't see the dragon's tail whipping from behind.

Denri slammed her hands into the rock, muscles on her arms flaring as she pulled herself free of the wall. Even with her increased speed, she couldn't cover the 40 foot distance to Aki in time to deflect the blow. She felt no fear for the danger Aki was in. Only excitement and curiosity. Denri needed to move faster. Could she meet the challenge?

Denri's body coiled like a spring as she supercharged her body. Not enough. She called more. Time slowed and nearly stopped. More. A giddy laugh slipped from her throat, half crazed as the energy overwhelmed her. A peel of thunder split the air as lightning struck.

When Denri normally shifted, it was something small, like her body was condensing and then moving. It left her feeling drained. But this. This was an explosion. Her body stretched, arcing from the wall to Tetsujin in an instant. Her body coursed with energy as her body reformed. She batted the dragon's tail away from Aki with ease.

As she landed on the rim, Denri could still feel the lightning. It taunted her, pulled against every cell in her body. It wanted to keep flowing. Demanded it.

Tetsujin burst forth from the rock with a snarl. The silver mane around his head snapped straight and a cloud of iron darts went flying toward them. Denri didn't even have to call the lightning. It leapt from her fingers as she raised her hand, spilling forward in a wave that scattered the needles in a thousand directions.

Aki's crow form dove towards the dragon again, landing against his skin as a leopard. She growled and there was another flash. Again Tetsujin laughed, batting her away with a gleaming claw.

"These are wonderful toys you've brought me, my lords." The dragon pierced the rock in front of him with his talons and the mountain shook. The ground split as iron spikes of all shapes and sizes erupted at their feet.

Denri sidestepped them lazily, the world moving in slow motion. She watched with curiosity as Aki struggled to dodge the emerging spikes, wondering what the girl would do next. Vaguely, she thought she should be doing something to help. But it was hard to focus with the lightning tugging at her thoughts, pulling her attention back to Tetsujin.

The dragon's black metal body snaked around the volcano's rim. Huge and powerful. She'd never faced a test like this. Didn't she want to see what she could do? What she could _really_ do. Denri opened herself to the lightning.

It felt like dying. And living.

She raised her hand in front of her face. Her fingers unraveled into threads of energy. The threads continued down her forearm, up her bicep, across her shoulder. Denri watched with fascination, the world frozen around her. She felt the threads stretching up her neck. And then she was free.

So long cramped and contained. Everything so sluggish. Like touching the world through a stiff leather glove. But now she was present. Her body flowed and expanded, pure energy held together by her will alone. She was the lightning.

The metal spikes all over the ground let out a loud groan. It was easy, reaching out and shaping the charge in the air, bending each iron pillar to the ground. The threat gone, Aki looked around. Denri felt the barest flicker of confusion at the back of her mind. She pushed it away.

A gout of silver flame washed over Denri's body. It was strong. It pulled at her. Tried to burn her, turn her to fire. But she was lightning. And it was not strong enough. Denri arced forward, wrapping around the flame playfully. Gripping it in her elemental hands. Squeezing until the flame gasped for air and sputtered out. Tetsujin's head pulled back in surprise.

Denri laughed. A dragon made of iron. Such a wonderful plaything. She let her body flow forward, wrapping around the Tetsujin. She bent the metal spikes with such ease. Would this steel serpent be any different?

"No!" A flash of guilt, easily brushed aside.

Denri flexed, and watched the dragon's body shake and quiver. Tetsujin groaned, his first sign of pain and fear. Denri smiled. Her puppet.

But why stop here? What else could she do? She turned, more a shifting of attention than an actual motion, and saw the Twins. Manabu's smug superiority was gone. He frowned, but he did not look afraid. He did not understand her power. She would change that. Denri sent a bolt at his chest.

The bolt moved too fast for him to dodge. Manabu's eyes widened in shock. But there was a flash of light and Hideki was standing in the way. The crazy twin grabbed the lightning bolt with both hands, the muscles on his biological arm flaring as the jets of steam burst from his mechanical arm in hissing jets. He threw his hands up and the lightning arced skyward, narrowly missing Sky Furnace above.

Joy filled Denri. Such strength. This man would be a wonderful test of her power.

Again, she felt a flash of guilt in her mind. But this time, she felt a command alongside it. A command to stop. Rage overtook her. Who dared? She was lightning, and she would not be caged. She would not be held back. Denri turned and saw a young girl staring at her with a frown, sweat dripping down her face.

Denri threw forward a massive fist of crackling energy. But the girl's form shifted, shrinking to a bird as it evaded the blow. Denri was surprised. The girl moved with nearly the speed of lightning. The crow flew towards her. So bold! Denri threw her arms wide to meet the girl's charge.

But the girl was not charging towards her. At the last moment, the bird became a large cat and plunged through the rippling energy of Denri's body to the dragon held prisoner. Denri let her body bite the girl, but she ignored the shocks. There was a blinding flash of light.

Tetsujin roared. His smooth, snake-like scales snapped out, forming into long, jagged iron crystals. Long metal horns, like a deer's antlers, grew on his head. Black flame erupted all around his body.

These flames were different than before. Stronger. They burned and tore at Denri's body, forcing her to release the dragon. She pulled back, then brought a fist down on the dragon's midsection, crushing it into the rock. Tetsujin roared again, this time in pain. But he pulled himself free. The girl stood tall, holding one of his horns. Her eyes shone white.

Great metal pillars erupted from the ground, drawing Denri's body towards them. She pushed against them and they bent away. But more rose in their place. The dragon opened it's mouth and loosed a torrent of pure black fire.

Denri threw herself to meet it. Exalting at the challenge. She was still the greater force. She could feel it. The black flames halted, began to twist in on themselves beneath her grasp. She laughed.

But the metal rods still pulled at her from behind. And the dragon's flame was slow to die. They held her in place.

A hammer blow struck her mind. The girl again, but stronger this time. Denri felt another presence behind it, reinforcing the girl's strength. Ancient, stubborn like iron. Tetsujin.

The dragon and girl roared together as they redoubled their efforts. The fire held, pushing itself to a stalemate against Denri's lightning. The force in Denri's mind inched forward. Step by step it wrapped itself around her. Holding her. Caging her.

Denri screamed. She would not be held. Lightning was free. Anything else was death. She lashed out, sending bolts of lightning in all directions. One ripped along Tetsujin's side, leaving a long trail of red. Another crashed into the side of Kazora, exploding the rock.

But the girl would not be stopped. With one last, frantic push, she wrapped herself around Denri's mind, pinning her completely. And the world went black.

<br />

<br />
<br />

Denri sat in a wheeled chair, straining not to move as the guard pushed her up one of Castle Six's large ramps. Every inch of her body throbbed. Turning her head too quickly made her vision swim.

When she first woke, she had tried to leap to her feet, mind still caught in the battle from before. Her muscles were so weak she barely managed to flop over the edge of the bed. Even that movement had left her shaking on the floor, tears streaming down her cheeks.

All she could do right now was think.

They were back in Castle Six. She was clean. And her wounds had been treated. Had they won the challenge? The last thing she remembered clearly was being knocked into a wall by Tetsujin. The rest was a collection of images with little context. Had she seen Aki standing atop Tetsujin's head?

The guard wheeled Denri to the large double doors that lead to the Twins main chamber and stopped.

"If you're waiting on me to open it, we might be hear a while buddy."

"Our presence is known. The Twins will summon you when they see fit." Something about the guard's clipped voice sounded familiar to Denri, but she couldn't turn her head to see the woman's face. They waited in silence for a moment before a distracted drum beat sounded on the other side of the door.

The guard bumped the chair as she passed to open the doors, sending a wave of pain through Denri's battered limbs. When the guard turned around, Denri saw it was the female Arbiter that had first raised the alarm at the Scale and Talon. The scar under her eye was pale and bloodless as the woman glowered at Denri.

Denri was about to make a quip when the double doors swung open and she did a double take. Standing at the threshold, bouncing from foot to foot like she desperately had to pee, was Aki. But despite the childish motions, the girl no longer looked like a child.

Gone were the gangly limbs and awkward face of a teenager. Replaced by the curves and serious looks of a woman. Her left eye was now a bright blue like Denri's. People probably would have called her beautiful, if not for the large scar covering her other eye. She was still beautiful, but Denri doubted that would be anyone's first thought in seeing Aki's fierce, wild features.

Happiness filled Denri's mind. Partly her own, but a large portion from Aki as well. "Denri!" She started to bounce toward her.

"I love you kid, but I think if you touch me right now I'm going to pass out. Let's save the hugs for later."

Aki pulled up short, looking disappointed. She could still pout like a 10 year old.

Denri sighed. "Alright, fine. One hug. But _very_ gently please."

"I can be gentle!" Aki raced forward and Denri's body tensed in anticipation of a collision. But Aki slowed at the last minute, making a show of slowly wrapping her arms around Denri and giving her shoulders the barest of taps.

If Aki was here, and this relaxed, then things must have turned out alright. Somehow, the girl must have defeated Tetsujin on her own.

"You look like an old lady!"

Aki looked at herself self consciously. "I thought I looked pretty! Do I really look old?"

Denri laughed, causing another spasm of pain. "Only kidding. But how did you get like this?"

"Hideki thinks I used my power on myself subconsciously, making my body older to handle the bond with Tetsujin."

In her mind's eye, Denri saw the image of Aki riding Tetsujin again. The dragon's scales flared like daggers, gleaming horns erupting from his mane of iron. His fire black as it raged against Denri's body. Her body like a cloud of lightning.

"What happened in the fight? Everything is hazy at the end for some reason."

A flash of concern. "Hideki can explain." She grabbed the handles on Denri's chair and pushed her towards the Twins' thrones.

"You keep talking about Hideki like he's going to help us..."

"He is! I think..." Aki's voice wavered for a second. "I told them we had to wait until you woke up to talk. I think you're going to like him. He's silly."

There was a crack and a flash of light. Hideki was standing in front of them. "Who's silly?" Without waiting for an answer he bent forward, bringing his face uncomfortably close to Denri's and peering into her eyes. "How do you feel? Are you having strange thoughts? Any unexplained new powers? Don't leave anything out!"

Hideki hitched his head to the side. "It's not rude! I'm just curious." He reached a hand towards Denri's wrist.

"If you touch me right now, I will zap you so hard you can't feel anything in that hand for a week."

Denri said it in a mocking tone, and Hideki didn't seem offended, but the Twin did pull his hand back hastily. "Don't say that. Now he's going to think he was right!"

Denri turned her head to Aki. "Do you have any idea what he's talking about?"

The girl shrugged. "He says he has a farmer in his head. I don't really understand."

Hideki still had his face pressed close to Denri. "Hey! Are you _sniffing_ me? What's the deal!"

"I'm just checking to see if your body is still ionizing the air around you. No one has ever fully manifested a region from an elemental plane before. I don't want to miss a single detail!"

Manabu cleared his throat from his throne. "Hideki, save the observations for later. We have more pressing matters to discuss." His voice was stern enough to call Hideki back to his throne.

"Fine! Let's talk about the boring things."

Denri spoke before Manabu had a chance to continue. "Can someone please explain what's going on? Why is he so interested in me?"

Manabu glowered at Denri for a second before answering her question. "Most elemental resonants are only strong enough to pull from sources of their element in the world around us. But these mundane elements are only shadows. Remains of a time when the five elemental realms were more strongly connected to our world and flowed more freely.

"In those realms, the elements exist in their truest sense. It is difficult to understand, having seen only their presence in our world. But there, the elements have minds and personalities all their own.

"Powerful resonants who are strongly aligned with one of these personalities are able to draw energy from the realm directly. But even then, the draw is weakened. Some calamity a long time ago damaged our connection to the other realms.

"It seems, however, that when your friend healed you, she did more than just heal your body. She healed your connection to the other realms. As a result, when you channeled lightning, you were dealing with the full, unmitigated flow. That flow overwhelmed you with its own desire to reenter our world, and you became a being of pure lightning."

Denri struggled to understand what Manabu was saying. She remembered feeling different during the fight with Tetsujin. Everything had seemed easier. Her attacks more powerful. Tentatively, she reached out for the lightning again.

"I would not do that. Using any resonant bond will affect your mind. But with the strength of your connection now, that affect will be overwhelming. You may very well lose yourself like you did during the battle."

Denri pulled back. "You're saying it's dangerous to use my power?"

"For now, yes. Once you have healed, it is unclear. My brother can train you to use your resonance more skillfully. He is no doubt interested in studying you. Perhaps that will be enough. But you will have to be on guard."

Denri turned to Aki. "Can you undo the... healing that you did?"

"She could, but without a subtle hand, she could very well destroy your resonance completely. Pushing your bond to its maximum required a great deal of power, but very little precision. Targeting a specific level of connection is far more subtle."

Denri turned back to the Twins. "How do you all know so much about all this?"

Manabu shifted in his seat. Denri could tell if it was from discomfort, or excitement. "Now we reach the part of the discussion that is truly important." Hideki yawned theatrically, but Manabu continued. "Yes, we know a good deal about Aki's powers. And the information contained in the book you stole. It involves a secret of the gods themselves.

"But I will be frank with you. There is much we don't understand. Things that I believe the two of you would be able to shed light upon, if you were to be more forthright.

"You won your challenge. You are free to go and we cannot stop you. But I offer you fuller cooperation now, if you are willing to trust us."

"What are you saying?"

"We are offering to be your patron in the Tournament. We will offer our protection, and share what we know about Aki's powers, if you in turn tell us what you know.

Hideki jumped in hastily. "And let us study you!" After a look from Manabu he softened. "Nothing invasive, of course! And nothing you don't agree to first. Just some tests of your abilities. We may even be able to help Aki return Denri's power to safer levels."

Denri was momentarily stunned. Was the offer sincere? They could be lying. Trying to learn what Aki and Denri knew before betraying them. But they had won the challenge. If they did plan to betray them, there was only so much they could actually do. Certainly less than what Sadashi could.

But she should probably wait until they had a chance to talk to Eizo. But they needed strong allies. And information. They were being offered everything they needed.

"Deal." Manabu and Hideki both smiled, relief plain on their faces. "But you have to tell us what you know about Aki's power first. Now."

"Very well. Do you want the simple story, or the more complicated one?"

Denri's head was still throbbing. And they really should talk to Eizo as soon as they could. "Simple is fine to start."

"There is a stone. Whether it has always existed or was constructed, we do not know. But it is the source of the Gods' power. Each of them holds a fragment. The stone is able to sculpt our world's connections to the primordial planes that formed it. That power lets them reshape our world nearly any way they see fit. We believe that Aki was raised in proximity to a shard of the stone, and is therefore connected to it as well.

"Since we discovered its existence, Amaterasu, has let us study the Godstone. Only superficially, of course. We've never been able to test any of our theories by exposing creatures to the stone. But we know enough to help Aki develop her power."

Denri's mind was quickly reaching the limit of new information that it was able to process. "And in exchange, you get to study the stones effects more directly."

"That is correct."

"Things might be a bit more complicated than that." As quickly as she could, Denri gave them a truncated summary of their encounters since leaving Terminus. "So Sadashi knows what's going on. So does Emiko. And Danzo knew _something_ was up. Enough to kidnap Aki. And it seems like at least one of the gods has to be providing access to the stone, right?"

"What are you trying to say?"

"These other kids that Sadashi is experimenting on are Aki's family. We have to go rescue them. But there are a lot of powerful people who will come after us if we do that. And I don't want to stop there. Whatever Sadashi is planning. I want to find out what it is and stop it so no other kids get hurt. So things are probably going to escalate. If you want to be our ally, then you have to have our back. Not just trading information."

Manabu frowned. "We can offer you protection as Aki trains. But we have no interest in a larger conflict."

Denri shrugged her shoulders, a painful maneuver. "Then no deal. We'll find our own path, and all those other kids who _also_ got exposed to the Godstone will come with us. With all those kids, I'm sure we'll learn all sorts of things about how the stone works. Surely enough for Aki to get more powerful."

Hideki inched forward in his seat, eyes shining greedily.

Aki took a step forward with hands on hips. "And Tetsujin is bound to _me_ now. I'm sure we won't have much trouble if he's with us. Too bad about all of Sky Furnace's zeppelins sinking into the ocean."

Even Denri turned towards Aki, mouth agape. Fierce indeed.

Manabu frowned. He looked to Hideki, but the other Twin already seemed to know which decision he wanted to make.

"Very well. We will do what we can to help you train and discover Sadashi's plan. And as you rescue the other children, we will provide them protection here. But in exchange, you will let us study your abilities. And Tetsujin stays here."

Aki crossed her arms. "No more experimenting on Tetsujin, though. And you have to power your forges some other way."

Manabu waved a hand angrily. "So be it."

Aki nodded to Denri.

"I would shake your hand if I could moved my muscles more than an inch, but you've got yourselves an alliance. Sadashi won't kjnow what hit him."
