It was safe to say that Denri was panicking.

The feeling was odd. Distant, yet all too familiar. She had thought she was past this.

She crashed through the forest underbrush, leaping over decayed tree trunks and shouldering through the vines and shrubs that pulled against her clothes. She gripped Aki's hand tightly, pulling the young girl along and trying to ignore growing pain in her injured foot. The dense forest around them reverberated with an incessant cawing.

Denri saw flashes of black feathered bodies leaping from tree to tree. The tengu looked like a cross between a small child and a crow. They were the same size and general shape as her, but their legs ended in vicious talons. Their bodies were covered in black feathers, ending in large wings instead of arms. Their eyes were black and beady, overlooking a straight black beak.

Denri ducked as one of the creatures swooped from above, narrowly missing her shoulder. Her eyes glowed blue in the dark forest gloom, hunting desperately for a place to hide. Aki stumbled blindly behind, her human eyes unable to see in darkness like Denri's.

Up ahead, Denri could see the trees thinning, giving way to raw stone formations, the beginnings of the mountain range they needed to traverse. Denri squinted against the distance. It looked like there was a slash of darkness against one of the rocks. Was it a cave mouth? The distance made it hard to tell for sure, but it was their only hope.

The cawing was louder behind them, centered on Eizo. When the beasts had appeared, he had raised his staff and told the other two to run. Her last image of the man was his tall, thin frame standing resolutely as the tengu descended on him. The width of his shoulders and ease with which he held his weapon suggested to Denri that Eizo was once a formidable fighter. But he was badly emaciated from his time in captivity. Denri didn't think she would see him again.

Aki's hand ripped free of Denri's grip. There was a sharp inhale of surprise. 

Denri pivoted, skidding to a halt. She could see Aki a few feet behind her, being lifted into the air by one of the foul creatures. Aki's hand was still outstretched towards Denri, as though she hadn't yet processed the new situation.

Denri's mind pulled towards Aki, driving her to save the young girl. But her feet stayed rooted, her heart hammering in her ears. She was frozen, spiraling downward into the tengu's cold, black, compassionless eyes. Her stomach churned at the smell of carrion and rot emanating from the creatures.

Denri's eyes lost focus as she heard the cries of her parents, telling her to run. 

Denri was pulled back to the present by the hiss of onrushing wind. She tried to throw herself to the side, but her injured foot finally gave out. She stumbled forward, grunting in pain. As she fell she felt a fire in both shoulders as talons wrapped around her. The world shifted violently as she was lifted from the ground, her vision bobbing with the motion of the tengu that had grabbed her.

Denri knew that she should be doing something. Trying to escape. Trying to save Aki. But the weight of her memories left her paralyzed in fear. It was all happening again.

There was a crash and a yell as Eizo came charging through the woods. He raised his staff, arms dripping blood from several wounds. He held the weapon at one end, swinging with both hands towards the creature carrying Aki. The tengu let out a pained caw as the staff managed to connect with the creature's wing. The blow sent it swerving into a tree. Aki fell to the ground heavily.

Eizo's arrival was enough to pull Denri from her panic. She twisted in the creature's grip, its talons pressing deeper into the muscles of her shoulder and drawing a whimper from her lips. She focused on the ground, near the cave she had seen earlier, then took a mental step towards it.

The crow tengu cried out in surprise as its prey suddenly vanished from its hands, replaced by an arc of electricity shooting towards the ground. Denri reappeared by the cave and turned towards her friends. "Over here! There's a cave we can use to hold them off!"

Eizo caught Aki under the arms, scooping her off the ground and into his arms as he ran by her. His face was set in a grimace like iron as he pushed his body to outpace the caws looming in the darkness behind him.

Eizo made it to the cave right as a tengu dove into him, its legs stretched out in front and it's wings thrown out behind. It's talons dug into the meat of Eizo's back and sent them both careening through the mouth of the cave. Eizo did his best to curl his body around Aki as he hit the ground.

The cave was a riot of flesh and feathers. From his prone position, Eizo brought his staff up to block the talons of the angry tengu looming over him.

Denri pressed herself against the wall.

Eizo managed to catch a taloned strike with one end of the staff, then swept the tengu's remaining foot with the other end. It went sprawling to the ground.

Eizo was standing in the span of a heartbeat. The butt of his staff struck against the tengu's head with practiced precision. It's angry squawks turned to groggy whimpers.

Eizo left the stupefied creature and ran to the entrance of the cave. He brought his staff up and readied himself for the coming onslaught. But the onrushing tengu now saw the odds had shifted. They would have to attack one at a time, with no room to maneuver. A few of the beasts made a few careful swipes at Eizo, but when he held firm they turned and fled into the woods. 

They were safe, for now.

"We should kill it." Denri stood as far from the crow tengu as she could. The creature sat with its back to one of the cave walls, its arms and legs bound by the bit of rope Denri had scavenged from her home in Terminus before they fled. The creature's body was tense, its eyes tracking every motion in front of it.

"I do not kill." Eizo leaned heavily against his staff. His arms and back were wrapped in some of the bandages that they had brought along for Denri's foot, but there was little else they could do for him. He had only been free from bondage for a week, and they had been fleeing that whole time. His body needed time to recover.

Denri sighed and gestured towards Eizo. "You expect me to believe that you've never killed anyone after watching you fight? With all those scars? I know you want to hide your past but don't pick something that's so obviously a lie."

Eizo flinched as though she had hit him. He looked towards the ground. "I do not kill _anymore_." His voice was soft.

"That's a noble goal. The world would be a lot better if people weren't so eager to kill. But when you _do_ find something evil, you have a responsibility to stop it."

"And how do you know if something is evil? Who are you to decide when something is beyond redemption?"

Denri waved her hands dismissively. "Questions like that are designed to paralyze people. If you overthink it, you can create certainty or doubt around anything. But we _know_ when someone is evil or dangerous to others. It's one thing to seek more context and try everything you can to be merciful. But it's a different thing to spare someone or something that's obviously going to hurt others just because you feel guilty about things you did in your past."

Throughout the conversation, the crow tengu remained passive. Its attention shifted back and forth between Denri and Eizo as they spoke, but it showed no sign of whether it understood their conversation, or was simply following the sounds.

"I used to be just as certain as you are. But my judgment proved wrong too many times. Things I thought were right, turned out to be wrong. And things I thought were wrong turned out to be right. I do not believe it is as easy to tell good from bad as you think it is. And given the obvious fear and hatred you have for these creatures, I do not trust your judgment either."

"These things just attacked us! They tried to kill Aki! If we let this one go, that's just one more threat when they start hunting us again."

Eizo turned his back on the crow tengu, placing himself between Denri and the creature. "That may be true, but I will not let you harm this creature."

Denri took a step forward, clenching her fists.

Aki stomped between them, holding her hands up. Frustrated tears spilled down her cheeks. "Stop fighting! If anyone thinks something is wrong then we shouldn't do it. We're a family and family supports each other!"

Denri bit back a retort about only knowing each other for a week. Taking it out on Aki wasn't the right thing to do. And it didn't look like she was convincing Eizo one way or the other. She threw her hands in the air. "Fine. Do what you want." Denri stomped further into the cave.

<br />

<br />

Denri sat in the darkness, throwing rocks against the wall. She didn't understand people like Eizo. They always wanted to think about what was the right thing to do. To weigh things against each other and make complicated theories about what was wrong and what wasn't.

But doing the right thing wasn't something you thought about. In her experience, she always _felt_ what the right thing was. But when she tried to figure things out intellectually, she ended up justifying the things she wanted to do. Her mind was too crafty to really be trusted.

"Denri...?" Denri turned and saw Aki stumbling through the darkness of the cave.

"Over here." 

Aki turned towards the sound and made her way towards Denri's glowing eyes. She sat down a small distance away from Denri and pulled her knees up to her chest. "Are you still mad?"

Denri sighed. "No. I'm just not used to dealing with others when I make my decisions."

"Is that why you've been so different since we left Terminus?"

"What do you mean?"

Aki thought for a moment. "You seemed happier before. Are we making you sad?"

Denri couldn't help but smile at Aki as the young girl stared at her feet. She pushed on the girl playfully. "It's not you two. It's these woods. They bring back bad memories for me. They make me jumpy."

Aki let out the breath she was holding. She sidled closer to Denri, sliding under her arm and leaning against her shoulder. "What kind of memories?"

Denri paused. She hadn't willfully thought about those days for years. She didn't really want to relive them. But maybe telling someone might help her process the fear she'd been dealing with. "When I was your age, I lived with my mom and dad on a boat."

"Really? Did you go out to sea? What was it like?"

Denri chuckled. "Slow down there, one question at a time. Yes, we went out to sea. We were part of the crew for a trading vessel that moved goods up and down the eastern coast. We stayed pretty close to shore, though, so it probably wasn't as grand as you're thinking."

"But you must have had _some_ adventures! Did you see any sea monsters?"

"One time we did get pretty close to a giant squid."

Aki gasped. "Were you scared? What did you do?"

"Of course I was scared! It was bigger than our boat! Some of the crew managed to scare it off by lighting a powder keg and throwing it into the water. Now _that_ was a cool explosion."

Aki put her hands on her hips. "That's mean! I wouldn't have been scared. I would have tried to talk to it."

"Oh?" Denri raised her arms in the air and started waving them around Aki, she dropped her voice into a spooky monotone. "Even with it's massive tentacles thrashing about around you?" Denri grabbed Aki's sides and started tickling. 

The pair devolved into a fit of giggling as Aki tried to squirm free. Eventually Shiri's feline eyes peered around the corner, gleaming in the dim cave light. Aki threw her arms wide.

"Shiri! You found us."

"Of course he did. Those two cats have lived on the streets for years. They know how to steer clear of trouble and find their way back."

The mottled cat stalked forward, stepping across Aki's legs and arching his back. Aki pet him dutifully as he took his usual position of ownership on her lap.

"So why did your family stop living on a boat?"

"Living on a boat you end up dealing with a lot of storms. Growing up, they were always my favorite part of sailing. I thought they were beautiful, crackling through the sky on the horizon. And when you got caught in one it was such a wild rush. There's nothing quite like the thrill of fighting the elements, knowing any minute your boat could crash against the rocks.

"Eventually, that's exactly what happened. Our ship got caught in a big storm and wrecked against the rocks. My family barely made it back to land alive."

"That's horrible."

Denri shrugged. "It's just how nature works. If the storms didn't make things dangerous, we wouldn't have been able to make a living taking risks on other people's behalf.

"Anyways, we washed up pretty close to a town that was a bit further south than Terminus. It was a small place, probably some new village set up by a recent Champion. We came knocking on their door, begging for help." Denri's fists clenched. "But they sent us away."

"Why would they send people away?"

"Of all the five races, flits have the closest bond with the god that created them. Pretty much all of us take after Susano. But this town's champion was allied with Sakuya, one of the gods opposed to the Stormbringer. So the champion didn't let us in. They said letting us in might diminish Sakuya's favor and weaken the town.

"My parents died trying to get us through the woods to find someplace else."

Aki burrowed deeper against Denri's side, giving a hug. "That must have been really scary."

Denri's hands were still clenched, her knuckles white. "I never minded the storm. Gods and nature are what they are. But I'll never understand a person who sees someone else in need and thinks of anything but helping."

Aki lay against Denri quietly for a few moments, petting Shiri in the darkness. "Why didn't you want to help the tengu we caught, then?"

Denri looked down at Aki, the girl was staring blindly into the cave. "Those monsters are just as bad as the champion that wouldn't let my family in. They see people walking through the forest, scared and lost, and they prey upon them. They killed my parents without thinking twice. They're the reason only Heroes are able to travel between towns."

Aki looked up at Denri, her chin thrust forward defiantly. "But no one ever tries to talk to them. What if they're just scared too? Maybe they think they're defending themselves."

Denri patted Aki's hand. "Believe me, I would love to learn that this has all been a big misunderstanding and the wilds aren't actually as dangerous as we think. But we can't talk with them. They're like animals."

Aki prickled. "Just because they're like animals doesn't mean we can't talk and try to understand them! Shiri is an animal but you know what he wants. You forgive him when he bites your finger."

"That's different."

"It's not different! When we tied up that tengu it didn't look like it hated us. It just looked scared and lost. I don't think it really wanted to hurt us, it just didn't know any better because no one bothered to try and teach it."

"I think you're just imagining things. That creature didn't show any emotion at all while we had it tied up."

"It did. You just weren't trying to look for it." Aki stood up, holding Shiri in her arms. "Eizo was right to let it go." Aki stamped away into the darkness Before Denri could respond.

"Well, I guess that's both of them angry with me now."
