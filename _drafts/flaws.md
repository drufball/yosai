It was safe to say that Denri was panicking.

The feeling was odd. Distant, yet all too familiar. She had thought she was past this.

She crashed through the forest underbrush, leaping over decayed tree trunks and shouldering through the vines and shrubs that pulled against her clothes. She gripped Aki's hand tightly, pulling the young girl along and trying to ignore growing pain in her injured foot. The dense forest around them reverberated with an incessant cawing.

Denri saw flashes of black feathered bodies leaping from tree to tree. The tengu looked like a cross between a small child and a crow. They were the same size and general shape as her. But their legs ended in vicious talons; their bodies were covered in black feathers, ending in large wings instead of arms; their eyes were black and beady, overlooking a straight black beak.

Denri ducked as one of the creatures swooped from above, narrowly missing her shoulder. Her eyes glowed blue in the dark forest gloom, hunting desperately for a place to hide. Aki stumbled blindly behind, her human eyes unable to see in darkness like Denri's.

Up ahead, Denri could see the trees thinning, giving way to raw stone formations, the beginnings of the mountain range they needed to traverse. Denri squinted against the distance. It looked like there was a slash of darkness against one of the rocks. Was it a cave mouth? The distance made it hard to tell for sure, but it was their only hope.

The cawing was louder behind them, centered on Eizo. When the beasts had appeared, he had raised his staff and told the other two to run. Her last image of the man was his tall, thin frame standing resolutely as most of the tengu descended on him. The width of his shoulders and ease with which he held his weapon suggested to Denri that Eizo was once a formidable fighter. But he was badly emaciated from his time in captivity. Denri didn't think she would see the man again.

Aki's hand ripped free of Denri's grip. There was a sharp inhale of surprise. 

Denri pivoted instantly, skidding to a halt. She could see Aki a few feet behind her, being lifted into the air by one of the foul creatures. Aki's hand was still outstretched towards Denri, as though she hadn't yet processed the new situation.

Denri's mind pulled towards Aki, driving her to save the young girl. But her feet stayed rooted, her heart hammering in her ears. She was frozen, spiraling downward into the tengu's cold, black, compassionless eyes. Her stomach churned at the smell of carrion and rot emanating from the creatures.

Denri's eyes lost focus as she heard the cries of her parents, telling her to run. 

Denri was pulled back to the present by the hiss of onrushing wind. She tried to throw herself to the side, but her injured foot finally gave out. She stumbled forward, grunting in pain. As she fell forward she felt a fire in both shoulders as talons wrapped around her. The world shifted violently as she was lifted from the ground, her vision bobbing with the motion of the tengu that had grabbed her.

Denri knew that she should be doing something. Trying to escape, to save Aki. But the weight of her memories left her paralyzed in fear. It was all happening again.

There was a crash and a yell as Eizo came charging through the woods. He moved at the corner of Denri's vision, but she could see him raise his staff, arms dripping blood from several wounds. He held the weapon at one end, swinging with both hands towards the creature carrying Aki. The tengu let out a pained caw as the staff managed to connect with the creature's wing. The blow sent it swerving into a tree. Aki fell to the ground heavily.

Eizo's arrival was enough to pull Denri from her panic. She twisted in the creature's grip, its talons pressing deeper into the muscles of her shoulder and drawing a whimper from her lips. She focused on the ground, near the cave she had seen earlier, then took a mental step towards it.

The crow tengu cried out in surprise as its prey suddenly vanished from its hands, replaced by an arc of electricity shooting towards the ground. Denri reappeared by the cave and turned towards her friends. "Over here! There's a cave we can use to hide from them!"

Eizo caught Aki under the arms, scooping her off the ground and into his arms as he ran by her. His face was set in a grimace like iron as he pushed his body to outpace the caws looming in the darkness behind him.

Eizo made it to the cave right as a tengu dove into him, its legs stretched out in front and it's wings thrown out behind. It's talons dug into the meat of Eizo's back and sent them both careening through the mouth of the cave. Eizo did his best to curl his body around Aki as he hit the ground.

The cave was suddenly a riot of flesh and feathers. From his prone position, Eizo brought his staff up to block the talons of the angry tengu looming over him.

Denri pressed herself against the wall.

Eizo managed to catch one taloned foot with one end of the staff, then swept the tengu's remaining foot with the other side of the staff. It went sprawling to the ground.

Eizo was standing in the span of a heartbeat. The butt of his staff struck against the tengu's head with practiced precision. It's angry squawks ceased turned to groggy whimpers.

Eizo left the stupefied creature and ran to the entrance of the cave. He brought his staff up and readied himself for the coming onslaught. But the onrushing tengu now saw the odds had shifted. They would have to attack one at a time, with no room to maneuver. A few of the beasts made a few careful swipes at Eizo, but when he held firm they turned and fled into the woods. 

They were safe, for now.
