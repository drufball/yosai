It was safe to say that Denri was panicking.

The feeling was odd. Distant, yet all too familiar. She had thought she was past this.

She crashed through the forest underbrush, leaping over decayed tree trunks and shouldering through the vines and shrubs that pulled against her clothes. She gripped Aki's hand tightly, pulling the young girl along and trying to ignore growing pain in her injured foot. The dense forest around them reverberated with an incessant cawing.

Denri saw flashes of black feathered bodies leaping from tree to tree. The tengu looked like a cross between a small child and a crow. They were the same size and general shape as her, but their legs ended in vicious talons. Their bodies were covered in black feathers, ending in large wings instead of arms. Their eyes were black and beady, overlooking a straight black beak.

Denri ducked as one of the creatures swooped from above, narrowly missing her shoulder. Her eyes glowed blue in the dark forest gloom, hunting desperately for a place to hide. Aki stumbled blindly behind, her human eyes unable to see in darkness like Denri's.

Up ahead, Denri could see the trees thinning, giving way to raw stone formations, the beginnings of the mountain range they needed to traverse. Denri squinted against the distance. It looked like there was a slash of darkness against one of the rocks. Was it a cave mouth? The distance made it hard to tell for sure, but it was their only hope.

The cawing was louder behind them, centered on Eizo. When the beasts had appeared, he had raised his staff and told the other two to run. Her last image of the man was his tall, thin frame standing resolutely as the tengu descended on him. The width of his shoulders and ease with which he held his weapon suggested to Denri that Eizo was once a formidable fighter. But he was badly emaciated from his time in captivity. Denri didn't think she would see him again.

Aki's hand ripped free of Denri's grip. There was a sharp inhale of surprise. 

Denri pivoted, skidding to a halt. She could see Aki a few feet behind her, being lifted into the air by one of the foul creatures. Aki's hand was still outstretched towards Denri, as though she hadn't yet processed the new situation.

Denri's mind pulled towards Aki, driving her to save the young girl. But her feet stayed rooted, her heart hammering in her ears. She was frozen, spiraling downward into the tengu's cold, black, compassionless eyes. Her stomach churned at the smell of carrion and rot emanating from the creatures.

Denri's eyes lost focus as she heard the cries of her parents, telling her to run. 

Denri was pulled back to the present by the hiss of onrushing wind. She tried to throw herself to the side, but her injured foot finally gave out. She stumbled forward, grunting in pain. As she fell she felt a fire in both shoulders as talons wrapped around her. The world shifted violently as she was lifted from the ground, her vision bobbing with the motion of the tengu that had grabbed her.

Denri knew that she should be doing something. Trying to escape. Trying to save Aki. But the weight of her memories left her paralyzed in fear. It was all happening again.

There was a crash and a yell as Eizo came charging through the woods. He raised his staff, arms dripping blood from several wounds. He held the weapon at one end, swinging with both hands towards the creature carrying Aki. The tengu let out a pained caw as the staff managed to connect with the creature's wing. The blow sent it swerving into a tree. Aki fell to the ground heavily.

Eizo's arrival was enough to pull Denri from her panic. She twisted in the creature's grip, its talons pressing deeper into the muscles of her shoulder and drawing a whimper from her lips. She focused on the ground, near the cave she had seen earlier, then took a mental step towards it.

The crow tengu cried out in surprise as its prey suddenly vanished from its hands, replaced by an arc of electricity shooting towards the ground. Denri reappeared by the cave and turned towards her friends. "Over here! There's a cave we can use to hold them off!"

Eizo caught Aki under the arms, scooping her off the ground and into his arms as he ran by her. His face was set in a grimace like iron as he pushed his body to outpace the caws looming in the darkness behind him.

Eizo made it to the cave right as a tengu dove into him, its legs stretched out in front and it's wings thrown out behind. It's talons dug into the meat of Eizo's back and sent them both careening through the mouth of the cave. Eizo did his best to curl his body around Aki as he hit the ground.

The cave was a riot of flesh and feathers. From his prone position, Eizo brought his staff up to block the talons of the angry tengu looming over him.

Denri pressed herself against the wall.

Eizo managed to catch a taloned strike with one end of the staff, then swept the tengu's remaining foot with the other end. It went sprawling to the ground.

Eizo was standing in the span of a heartbeat. The butt of his staff struck against the tengu's head with practiced precision. It's angry squawks turned to groggy whimpers.

Eizo left the stupefied creature and ran to the entrance of the cave. He brought his staff up and readied himself for the coming onslaught. But the onrushing tengu now saw the odds had shifted. They would have to attack one at a time, with no room to maneuver. A few of the beasts made a few careful swipes at Eizo, but when he held firm they turned and fled into the woods. 

They were safe, for now.

"We should kill it." Denri stood as far from the crow tengu as she could. The creature sat with its back to one of the cave walls, its arms and legs bound by the bit of rope Denri had scavenged from her home in Terminus before they fled. The creature's body was tense, its eyes tracking every motion in front of it.

"I do not kill." Eizo leaned heavily against his staff. His arms and back were wrapped in some of the bandages that they had brought along for Denri's foot, but there was little else they could do for him. He had only been free from bondage for a week, and they had been fleeing that whole time. His body needed time to recover.

Denri sighed and gestured towards Eizo. "You expect me to believe that you've never killed anyone after watching you fight? With all those scars? I know you want to hide your past but don't pick something that's so obviously a lie."

Eizo flinched as though she had hit him. He looked towards the ground. "I do not kill _anymore_." His voice was soft.

"That's a noble goal. The world would be a lot better if people weren't so eager to kill. But when you _do_ find something evil, you have a responsibility to stop it."

"And how do you know if something is evil? Who are you to decide when something is beyond redemption?"

Denri waved her hands dismissively. "Questions like that are designed to paralyze people. If you overthink it, you can create certainty or doubt around anything. But we _know_ when someone is evil or dangerous to others. It's one thing to seek more context and try everything you can to be merciful. But it's a different thing to spare someone or something that's obviously going to hurt others just because you feel guilty about things you did in your past."

Throughout the conversation, the crow tengu remained passive. Its attention shifted back and forth between Denri and Eizo as they spoke, but it showed no sign of whether it understood their conversation, or was simply following the sounds.

"I used to be just as certain as you are. But my judgment proved wrong too many times. Things I thought were right, turned out to be wrong. And things I thought were wrong turned out to be right. I do not believe it is as easy to tell good from bad as you think it is. And given the obvious fear and hatred you have for these creatures, I do not trust your judgment either."

"These things just attacked us! They tried to kill Aki! If we let this one go, that's just one more threat when they start hunting us again."

Eizo turned his back on the crow tengu, placing himself between Denri and the creature. "That may be true, but I will not let you harm this creature."

Denri took a step forward, clenching her fists.

Aki stomped between them, holding her hands up. Frustrated tears spilled down her cheeks. "Stop fighting! If anyone thinks something is wrong then we shouldn't do it. We're a family and family supports each other!"

Denri bit back a retort about only knowing each other for a week. Taking it out on Aki wasn't the right thing to do. And it didn't look like she was convincing Eizo one way or the other. She threw her hands in the air. "Fine. Do what you want." Denri stomped further into the cave.

<br />

<br />
<br />

Denri sat in the darkness, throwing rocks against the wall. She didn't understand people like Eizo. They always wanted to think about what was the right thing to do. To weigh things against each other and make complicated theories about what was wrong and what wasn't.

But doing the right thing wasn't something you thought about. In her experience, she always _felt_ what the right thing was. But when she tried to figure things out intellectually, she ended up justifying the things she wanted to do. Her mind was too crafty to really be trusted.

"Denri...?" Denri turned and saw Aki stumbling through the darkness of the cave.

"Over here." 

Aki turned towards the sound and made her way towards Denri's glowing eyes. She sat down a small distance away from Denri and pulled her knees up to her chest. "Are you still mad?"

Denri sighed. "No. I'm just not used to dealing with others when I make my decisions."

"Is that why you've been so different since we left Terminus?"

"What do you mean?"

Aki thought for a moment. "You seemed happier before. Are we making you sad?"

Denri couldn't help but smile at Aki as the young girl stared at her feet. She pushed on the girl playfully. "It's not you two. It's these woods. They bring back bad memories for me. They make me jumpy."

Aki let out the breath she was holding. She sidled closer to Denri, sliding under her arm and leaning against her shoulder. "What kind of memories?"

Denri paused. She hadn't willfully thought about those days for years. She didn't really want to relive them. But maybe telling someone might help her process the fear she'd been dealing with. "When I was your age, I lived with my mom and dad on a boat."

"Really? Did you go out to sea? What was it like?"

Denri chuckled. "Slow down there, one question at a time. Yes, we went out to sea. We worked on a trading vessel that moved goods up and down the eastern coast. We stayed pretty close to shore, though, so it probably wasn't as grand as you're thinking."

"But you must have had _some_ adventures! Did you see any sea monsters?"

"One time we did get pretty close to a giant squid."

Aki gasped. "Were you scared? What did you do?"

"Of course I was scared! It was bigger than our boat! Some of the crew managed to scare it off by lighting a powder keg and throwing it into the water. Now _that_ was a cool explosion."

Aki put her hands on her hips. "That's mean! I wouldn't have been scared. I would have tried to talk to it."

"Oh?" Denri raised her arms in the air and started waving them around Aki, she dropped her voice into a spooky monotone. "Even with it's massive tentacles thrashing about around you?" Denri grabbed Aki's sides and started tickling. The pair devolved into a fit of giggling as Aki tried to squirm free. 

Shiri's feline eyes peered around the corner, gleaming in the dim cave light. Aki threw her arms wide. "Shiri! You found us."

"Of course he did. Those two cats have lived on the streets for years. They know how to steer clear of trouble and find their way back."

The mottled cat stalked forward, stepping across Aki's legs and arching his back. Aki pet him dutifully as he took his usual position of ownership on her lap.

"Why did your family stop living on a boat?"

"Living on a boat you end up dealing with a lot of storms. Growing up, they were always my favorite part of sailing. I thought they were beautiful, crackling through the sky on the horizon. And when you got caught in one it was wild. There's nothing quite like the thrill of fighting the elements, knowing any minute your boat could crash against the rocks.

"Eventually, that's exactly what happened. Our ship got caught in a big storm and wrecked against the rocks. My family barely made it back to land alive."

Aki was silent for a moment. "That's horrible."

Denri shrugged. "It's just how nature works. If the storms didn't make things dangerous, we wouldn't have been able to make a living taking risks on other people's behalf.

"We washed up pretty close to a town that was further south than Terminus. It was a small place, probably some new village set up by a recent Champion. We came knocking on their door, begging for help." Denri's fists clenched. "But they sent us away."

"Why would they send people away?"

"Of all the five races, flits have the closest bond with the god that created them. Pretty much all of us take after Susano. But this town's champion was allied with Sakuya, one of the gods opposed to the Stormbringer. So the champion didn't let us in. They said letting us in might diminish Sakuya's favor and weaken the town.

"My parents died trying to get us through the woods to someplace else."

Aki burrowed deeper against Denri's side, giving a hug. "That must have been really scary."

Denri's hands were still clenched, her knuckles white. "I never minded the storm. Gods and nature are what they are. But I'll never understand a person who sees someone else in need and thinks of anything but helping."

Aki lay against Denri quietly for a few moments, petting Shiri in the darkness. Her movements were a bit tense as she worked herself up to say something. "Why didn't you want to help the tengu we caught, then?"

Denri looked down at Aki, the girl was staring blindly into the cave. "Those monsters are just as bad as the champion that wouldn't let my family in. They see people walking through the forest, scared and lost, and they prey upon them. They killed my parents without thinking twice. They're the reason only Heroes are able to travel between towns."

Aki looked up at Denri, her chin thrust forward defiantly. "But no one ever tries to talk to them. What if they're just scared too? Maybe they think they're defending themselves."

Denri patted Aki's hand. "Believe me, I would love to learn that this has all been a big misunderstanding and the wilds aren't actually as dangerous as we think. But we can't talk with them. They're like animals."

Aki prickled. "Just because they're like animals doesn't mean we can't talk and try to understand them! Shiri is an animal but you know what he wants. You forgive him when he bites your finger."

"That's different."

"It's not different! When we tied up that tengu it didn't look like it hated us. It just looked scared and lost. I don't think it really wanted to hurt us, it just didn't know any better because no one ever bothered to try and teach it."

"I think you're just imagining things. That creature didn't show any emotion at all while we had it tied up."

"It did. You just weren't trying to look for it." Aki stood up, holding Shiri in her arms. "Eizo was right to let it go." She stamped away into the darkness Before Denri could respond.

"Well, I guess that's both of them angry with me now."

<br />

<br />
<br />

They rose before dawn. Everyone saw to their own meager travel packs, avoiding eye contact and working in silence. Denri coiled the rope they had used to hold the Tengu and put it away. 

The air was cold and bright, snapping them all awake as they slipped out of the cave and began climbing the mountain. The slope quickly steepened, until their shivers were replaced by a thin sheen of sweat. The mist at their feet and the fog of their breath both burned away as the sun rose.

All three stopped to enjoy the view. They were a few hundred feet up, leaning forward against the steep slope. Jagged boulders cast long shadows around them. Below, the forest lay like a thick green carpet across the landscape, the last tendrils of mist coiling delicately in the shade of large cedar trees. The sun lit the sky a brilliant orange.

Denri let out a sigh, some of the tension in her shoulders fading. She hadn't seen a view like this since her time at sea. For a moment, she wished Aki was right about the monsters that lived in the wilds. She had grown fond of Terminus over the years, but the tight spaces and rigid, manmade lines never quite replaced the untamed beauty outside their walls.

"It's so pretty." Aki's voice was filled with awe. 

Denri tested the waters. "Have you ever seen anything like it before?"

Aki shook her head, ponytail flapping behind her. "Me and the other kids were never allowed outside."

"Other kids?"

"We should keep moving and stay quiet." Eizo gave a pointed look to Aki as he moved past her, continuing up the mountain.

All of them stepped a bit lighter after the brief interchange. They made more eye contact as they moved, and Denri even got a few smiles from Aki as she made faces behind Eizo's back. The sunrise had worked better than any apology or longwinded discussion to brighten everyone's mood.

It didn't last long. They had been hiking for an hour before they heard a chorus of crows cawing at the base of the mountain around the cave where they had slept. Denri and the others threw themselves behind a boulder, hoping none of the creatures had seen them. 

The eruption of sound send quickly shifted from chaos to silence.

"I guess they figured out we're not there anymore." Denri felt the familiar pit of fear form in her gut. But after the frantic chase from the day before and reliving some of her memories with Aki, she had had a chance to prepare herself. She wouldn't let it paralyze her like last time. "Why weren't they just waiting for us outside the entrance?"

Eizo looked calm. "They probably went back to camp to get help from their daitengu. And crow tengu aren't really intelligent enough to leave a guard behind."

"What's a daitengu?" Denri's firsthand knowledge of wilderness monsters was a handful of mostly repressed weeks screaming and running. And she hadn't exactly gone seeking more information out once she lived in Terminus. She never thought she'd be in a situation like this again.

"The crow tengu we saw yesterday are sort of like caterpillars. As they get older, most will die of old age. But some go through a transformation into daitengu. They get bigger and more intelligent. In that form, they're capable of speaking, fighting, and strategizing like the 5 races. Some can even resonate like Heroes. Every crow tengu flock is lead by a group of daitengu."

"Oh, great. I really felt like our experience yesterday was a little flat, you know?"

"Daitengu hunting us would be very bad." Eizo looked at her flatly. Onara's yellow eyes blinked at her over his shoulder, like she hadn't spent years living under Denri's roof. Until the fighting started, the cat preferred to travel on top of Eizo's pack. A pack of thin red scars marked the one time Eizo had tried to protest.

Aki squeezed Denri's hand. "_I'm_ glad you're being silly again." The little girl smiled.

Denri returned a shaky smile, her stomach a knot of tension. "I'm trying my best."

<br />

<br />

It didn't take long for the tengu to find them. For a while, it seemed like the creatures were focused on searching through the forest. Denri and the others stuck to the shadows of boulders as much as they could. But eventually the tengu turned their attention towards the mountain, and there was only so long they could hide against an enemy that could fly.

Denri stood atop a cliff face, breathing hard as she reached a hand down to help Aki up the ledge. The girl's hands and knees were covered in dirt and blood, yet she pushed on doggedly. "Did anyone ever tell you that you're pretty tough, kid?" Denri forced her voice to stay light, it was the only thing keeping the fear at bay.

A few hundred feet below them, the tengu were swarming up the mountain side. They ate the vertical distance with enormous leaps, their wings making light of the climb. The hunting party consisted of five crow tengu, their bodies small and black, along with two daitengu. If not for Eizo's assurances earlier, Denri would have thought them a completely different species. They were twice the size of the crow tengu, with muscular builds and smooth, red skin. They wore clothing and carried staffs in human-like arms. A pair of white wings emerged from their backs.

Eizo pulled himself over the edge of the cliff and looked around. The slope of the mountain was gentle here, allowing for easier footing. Many large stones had gathered in the relatively flat space. "We should make our stand here. It will give us our best chance." They moved further onto the plateau and found a narrow gap between two boulders. Aki wedged herself deep within the shadows. Shiri and Onara joined her, sensing the impending tension. 

Eizo and Denri walked a short distance, drawing the battle away from Aki. Many boulders had been eroded at their base, creating shallow overhangs that Denri and Eizo now used to provide some amount of cover from above. They stood with their backs pressed against a pair of closely placed boulders. "I will try my best to disable as many crow tengu as I can before the fight begins, but then I will focus on the daitengu. You will have to keep the crow tengu distracted."

Denri nodded, her hands shaking around the knotted club of wood she had gathered during the climb. It felt awkward in her hands. In Terminus she had been a thief, not a fighter.

They heard the predatory click and scrape of talons landing against the rocky earth of the plateau. There was a series of caws as the creatures coordinated, followed by an abrupt silence as they pushed into the air again. The tension persisted a heartbeat longer before there was another hail of clicks and scrapes, this time scattered around the boulders near the cliff. The pattern repeated itself. Silence. Talons. The sounds grew closer.

They heard a creature land on a stone nearby. Eizo took a small stone and bounced it off a nearby boulder. The nearby tengu made a curious sound, it's caw soft and with an upward inflection. Silence. There was a rush of feathers and disturbed earth as a crow tengu dropped to the ground amidst the boulders. It's back was to them.

Eizo pounced instantly. He brought his staff in a low sweep, cutting the creature's feet out from under it. As it fell, Eizo twisted the staff and delivered two sharp blows, one to the creature's chest and the other to the side of its head. The creature was unconscious before it hit the ground.

A chorus of cries erupted around them as the tengu responded to the dull thwack of Eizo's staff against feathered flesh. Eizo stepped back against the boulder as the tengu descended.

The remaining creatures had the sense to land together, alert and looking around them. Up close, Denri saw the daitengu did not have the large black beaks of the crow tengu. Besides the red skin and bone-white hair, the only difference between the daitengu faces and those humans was a long, beaklike nose.

Again, Eizo leapt forward without hesitation. Denri wondered if the man even understood what the word fear meant.

Eizo brought his staff upwards, cracking against the bottom of a crow tengu beak. Before the creature's body could acknowledge its new unconscious reality, Eizo twisted, aiming his weapon towards another black-feathered face. The tengu managed to pull itself back, absorbing the blow with a shoulder. It dropped to the ground squawking in pain. 

Eizo let his swing follow through and brought the butt of his staff up in a motion made smooth and automatic by years of training. His hands snapped forward sending a lethal strike towards the fallen creature's throat. Eizo's overwhelming skill gave Denri a surge of hope.

As his staff shot forward, Eizo's face contorted. He cried out and pushed his staff to the side, avoiding the fallen creature's throat and tearing a chunk from the ground. He paused for a heartbeat, breathing heavily and staring at his hands in disgust.

The remaining tengu capitalized on the hesitation. The two crow tengu leapt into the air while the daitengu struck forward with their staffs. Eizo regained his awareness in time to bring his staff up to block the blow aimed for his jaw. But the other staff whipped across his back, staggering him forward. 

Denri cursed, feeling her dread return. She forced herself to start moving, lest her muscles freeze again. Seeing Eizo surrounded, she felt an urge to rush forward and help. But she knew how little help she would be. She had to stick to the plan and have faith in Eizo. The two airborne monsters were her problem to deal with.

Denri grabbed a fist-sized rock and scrambled up the side of one of the boulders. She hurled the rock as hard as she could towards one of the crow tengu, catching it along the hip. The creature gave a sharp caw and dropped a few feet in the air before it regained its composure. It turned towards Denri and called to its companion. The two creatures dove towards her. 

Denri stared up at the creatures, fear rising in her belly like a wave crashing inexorably towards the shore. She forced herself to wait. At the last moment, right before the lead tengu's claws dug into her belly, Denri shifted to the boulder 30 feet away.

Expecting a soft, weighty target to absorb its impact, the tengu was moving too fast to react. It's claws briefly gripped a wisp of electricity, then nothing but air, as it crashed into the hard stone. The other tengu pulled up sharply, avoiding a second collision.

Denri reappeared in a flash of light. "How'd you like that move! I call it the 'you looked like an idiot' and I thought of it 20 seconds ago!" Denri turned and began jumping from stone to stone. Her left foot burned from her partially-healed burn, but she had been careful to double-wrap it tightly that morning. She had to hope it would hold as long as needed.

Denri looked over her shoulder to make sure she was being followed. She was. The tengu that had avoided the boulder was closing quickly. The other was further behind, holding one leg close to its chest. 

Denri turned, planning to engage the first tengu before the second could catch up. The creature brought its taloned legs forward and towards her. Denri raised her club, her heart hammering in her ears. The creature's form grew wider in her vision as it careened towards her. It's wings flared out.

Denri's nerve broke at the last minute and she dove to the side. Her shoulder burned as the tengu's talons cut through her skin and the weight of the impact sent her spinning off balance. She fell to the rock, jarring her other shoulder. She pushed to her hands and knees and threw herself forward as the second tengu lashed out more carefully with its remaining good talon.

Denri scrambled to her feet and started running again, blind panic pressing at the edges of her mind. She looked up and saw a distant flock of dark, feathered forms descending from higher up the mountain. More tengu would be joining the fight soon.

- Aki tries to help/talk to the tengu Eizo hurt, he tries to strike her
- Denri too far away to help. Hurt foot ultimately gets her and the tengu following her descend
- Eizo tied up by other tengu
- Captured tengu eventually arrives to protect Aki, save Eizo
- Aki can understand crow tengu
- Says he went back to roost to tell everyone, found a party had already left
- Daitengu skeptical, why should we trust someone with mark of Ninigi? Clearly here to hunt us.
- Eizo shows his samurai mark faded, says he no longer follows that path
- You are an outlaw just like us, offers for them to come back to the roost
- Denri reluctant, but accepts
