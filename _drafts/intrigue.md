The child's scream cut off, disappearing so suddenly it felt like missing a step. The pained cry echoed off the walls before fading into silence.

Moto and Keta locked eyes. "Do you think that was--?"

They winced as an entire den full of spiders screeched in response. The sound stabbed at their ears, so high-pitched it was almost inaudible. It wasn't long before they would hear the chaotic drum line of spider legs racing towards them.

"The kid! We've got to get to him before anything happens."

Keta nodded, then turned to the people he had freed from the webs. "We must go now. Hide here until you hear fighting, then run."

Moto and Keta ran from the room without waiting to see how the prisoners reacted. They already took a huge risk rescuing them from the spiders in the first place. As far as he was concerned, they could handle the rest.

Moto pulled the shutter all the way open on the lantern as they raced down the hallway. Their footsteps rang out against the stone as they worked their way back to the intersection. There was a loud snap as Keta crashed through one of the web trip wires stretched across the hall. No time left for caution.

What went wrong? They killed the spiders fast and quiet, just like Moto planned. Did a spider escape? But the scream started the instant he killed the light spider. The timing was too perfect to be a coincidence. Somehow the other spiders knew when it died. This was revenge.

They never should have interfered with the other prisoners. He pushed the thought aside. There would be time for berating himself later. Now they had to focus.

Keta slid to a halt at the intersection they passed through earlier. He looked down the tunnel to the right, towards the exit. The sound of skittering legs bounced down the hallway. A thousand dice being tossed to decide their fate.

"I could collapse the tunnel." Keta balled his hand into a fist.

Moto grabbed his wrist. "No. We don't know what to expect further in. We may need Iruka and Fumi's help down there more than we need them to handle the spiders at the front."

They continued left, their strides lengthening nearly out of control as the tunnel turned down sharply. Moto pulled on the walls and floor behind him to keep from falling forward. Keta's steps looked as much like leaping and falling as they did like running.

They took a sharp corner at full speed, Moto pulling against the inside wall and swinging around like a stone in a sling. Keta let his momentum carry him up the outside wall of the turn, diving off the stone into a forward roll in order to change direction.

On the other side of the bend, the way was completely blocked with webs. At the speed they were moving, there was no time to stop. Moto threw his arms over his face and pulled on the walls in front of him. His body accelerated as he tried to punch through.

He felt the stuttering pull of webs clinging then breaking under his momentum. He was slowing at an alarming rate. There was a sharp tug against his shoulder as a web finally managed to hold, spinning him around.

He barely had time to realize he was stuck before Keta crashed into him, arms wrapping around Moto's waist. There was a final lurch as the webs gave way and then they were falling through the air.

They kept falling. With a curse, Moto realized they had gone off another cliff. He pulled against the ceiling desperately, trying to stop their descent. But it had taken him too long to act. He wasn't strong enough to catch their full weight this far from the ceiling. All he could do was soften the blow.

They landed hard. Air shot out of Moto's lungs in a ragged wheeze as he took the brunt of the impact beneath Keta. His head snapped against stone and swirls of light danced across his vision. Keta bounced off of Moto, landing heavily a few feet away.

Moto groaned weakly, panic taking his mind as he tried and failed to breathe. He rocked onto his side and vomited. A sharp pain in his side told him at least one rib was broken.

Focus. Moto gritted his teeth and pressed himself into a sitting position. He shook his head to clear it, but that only set his vision spinning worse. He pressed his back against the rough stone wall and staggered to his feet.

They were standing at the bottom of another pit. Smooth floor and grooves running up the walls suggested running water had carved it long ago. A flickering light filled the room, sending shadows dancing and spinning across the walls. Their lantern had cracked open from the fall, igniting a patch of webbing near the edge of the cavern. The shifting lights heightened Moto's instability.

A few feet ahead, Keta remained prone. The shapeling struggled against a clump of webbing that stretched across the ground and held him fast. Moto took an unsteady step forward.

"S-Stay away!"

The whimpering voice drew Moto's attention further into the cavern. A young boy was scrambling backwards across the stone, one hand held to his head. The boy's clothes were ripped and badly worn. His hands were black with dirt and dried blood, and his short black hair was plastered to his head with grime.

Swarming around the boy was a herd of jorogumo. The boy hardly noticed them as they skittered across his hands and legs, his gaze remaining fixed on Moto and Keta. He must have been bitten.

Moto turned his attention back to Keta. He needed to get him free before those spiders attacked. But before he could move forward, the webbing around Keta shook violently. The shapeling cried out as a large gash opened along his shoulder.

There was a hiss of steam as Keta ripped his other arm free from the web and lashed out at the air. His hand stuttered as it connected with substance. Moto's vision flickered as a giant light spider resolved itself out of thin air. It hissed as it pulled back from Keta's blow, preparing to strike again.

Moto cursed, he took two drunken steps forward, swaying wildly. There was no way he could make it to Keta in his current condition. He grabbed a stone from behind and launched it toward the spider. The world tilted beneath him as he tried to aim and the rock went wide. It crashed into the ground at the boy's feet, shattering.

The boy cried out in pain as shrapnel shot past, scoring deep wounds in his arms. He screamed again, his eyes wide and staring as he reached out to the spiders swarming around him.

There was a blinding flash of light and Moto heard the spiders screeching, crying out as if being ripped apart.

When the light faded, the boy was lying unmoving amongst a pile of broken spiders. But the spiders weren't dead. Their bodies twitched across the ground as their skin stretched and ripped. Their forms grew grotesquely as they squealed in pain. A white glow emanated from the rents in their skin.

Slowly, five new light spiders pulled themselves from the ground. They hissed at Moto and Keta, who struggled with the light spider attacking him. Then they vanished.

<br />

<br />
<br />

Moto looked around in surprise. Without the spiders' light, there was nothing but the red glow of the spreading flames to light the room.

Could the spiders teleport? Moto took another breath, willing himself to think through the fog in his head. No. The webbing around Keta had moved before the spider appeared. They were still here. Just invisible.

Keta groaned with exertion, bringing Moto's attention back. The shapeling had pulled both arms free and was holding back the light spider's head as its fangs snapped at his neck. They seemed to be at an impasse for a moment, before Keta's arms flexed and he crushed the spiders' head between his hands. The boy twitched at the center of the room as it fell limp to the ground.

Keta was still struggling to free himself from the web. Moto reached forward and pulled with his power. The sudden shift in weight made him stagger forward, almost taking him off his feet. He held the wall to steady himself as Keta finally tore himself free and ran to his side.

Moto looked around, trying to form a plan. They couldn't track the spiders by the sound of their movements. Echoes from the walls made it impossible to tell the creatures' location. The stone floor prevented any footprints. He strained his eyes against the darkness, looking for shadows. Whatever the creatures' ability was, it seemed to block any visual trace of their presence.

His balance was still shifting beneath him, making precision impossible. If he couldn't aim, he'd just have to use another tact. Moto pulled against the littering of stones behind him and sent a scattershot through the room. There was a rocky clatter as most of the missiles struck the far wall, but a few stopped dead in the air, bouncing off the invisible spiders.

With his back this close to the wall he couldn't get any sort of acceleration on his shots. He needed more runway. But if they moved away from the wall they could be surrounded.

Light flared in front of Moto as a spider appeared, fangs bared. Moto pressed back against the wall and lashed out with his dagger. How had it avoided his scattershot?

He spun wildly as his dagger passed through thin air. The spider's shape flickered, then reformed. An illusion? There was a hiss to his right as another spider appeared, lunging toward him as he regained his balance.

There was a meaty _crack_ as Keta unfurled the weighted silks around his wrists and brought both down on the attacking spiders' face in an overhead swing. The spider screeched as it pulled back and disappeared. But a direct hit from Keta should have completely caved its head in.

Moto glanced sideways. The shapeling was breathing heavily beside him, the wound on his shoulder still bleeding.

"Are you too tired to pull fire?"

Before he could answer, another spider appeared, leaping through the air towards Keta. Moto reached out to pull the creature off course, but there was no substance to the image. Another illusion. Except, was there something behind it? Moto pushed further out and felt real weight, flying behind the illusion.

"It's not there! Aim behind it!"

Keta changed the angle of his strike mid swing and brought one of his silks across the side of the creature, knocking it into the wall. Before it could regain its feet Keta swung his other silk down on its head. There was a sickening crunch and the spider lay twitching mindlessly. Four left.

Keta pulled back against Moto, scanning the darkness around them. "I still have some fire left, but I do not want to be defenseless if one of us is bitten again. I can handle these creatures naturally for now. How did you know where it was?"

"My power has no effect on the illusions, but I can feel the weight of the real one behind it. It doesn't seem like they can make the images very far from their real body."

Could he use that? He could test the illusions when they attacked, but he had caught the presence of the first spider by accident. His pulls were narrow and he wouldn't have much time to find the real thing. Unless...

Moto closed his eyes and softened his focus. He sent his power in a broad pulse. Pulling softly in all directions. He felt a faint pull from Keta beside him, then something more solid from the wall at his back. There was a flutter in front of them.

"In front of us!"

Keta swung out with his silks, cutting a low arc that broke a couple legs of an approaching spider. It staggered, but managed to keep its feet. The sense wasn't precise, but it was something.

"I can tell where they are, but I can't focus on anything else while I'm doing it..."

"That is enough. I will strike where you tell me." Keta stepped forward, placing himself between Moto and the spiders.

He could sense the general direction of enemies as they approached, but that wasn't enough to land hits that drove the creatures back. Anyone else would have been swinging wildly, hoping for an occasional lucky shot. But Keta's speed and control made it work.

Even without using his power, the shapeling was able to react in real-time, adjusting his blows mid swing as he responded to the weight of impact. When he landed a solid hit, he pounced immediately, lashing out with several more against the vulnerable foe.

But soon the spiders adjusted their strategy. They started attacking all at once. They would snap forward in a wave, then retreat back out of range.

It didn't take long until Keta's body was covered in shallow gashes from narrowly dodged attacks. One of Moto's arms hung limply from a deep bite into the meat of his shoulder. At least the light spider transformation seemed to burn away the jorogumo's venom.

A chaotic wave of clicks and scrapes caught Moto's attention at the top of the cave, near the entrance. It was quiet at first. Hard to hear over the sounds of fighting. But it was growing louder. Reinforcements. But for who?

If it was more spiders, they would have to run. And if it was Fumi and Iruka, how would the light spiders react? They were focused on Moto and Keta now, while they had the upper hand. But if things looked bad, they might attack the kid to buy time for an escape. They needed to get to the boy.

But holding the light spiders off was hard enough while they only came from the front. If they moved to the center of the room, Keta couldn't cover every angle. Moto's balance had mostly returned, and the extra space would let him start throwing stones again. But using his power on offense would mean he couldn't detect the spiders.

If only Iruka was here. They needed two stone-bringers so they could use their gravity on offense and defense at the same time.

At the same time... Moto's eyes snapped open. "I've got a plan!"

Keta laughed between ragged breaths. "It is about time! I was beginning to think that you were slipping." He swung one of his yellow silks into the face of an onrushing spider.

"It's going to take two bursts of energy from you. Do you have that?"

"Yes, but not much more. I won't be able to heal us anymore."

Moto looked briefly at the blood covering Keta's arms. The wound in his own shoulder was bad too. There wasn't any other choice. If they made it out, they could bind their wounds until Keta recovered enough to heal them.

"We'll have to take a risk then. On my mark we're going to charge toward the boy. We have to reach him. Ignore everything else. Once we get him, I need you to pump me up with one blast. Then when I say so, use the second burst to jump as high as you possibly can."

Keta nodded, no sign of doubt on his face. "I will be ready."

"As _high_ as you can. Go!"

Keta took off without hesitation, angling low as he ran. The shapeling's body rocked sideways as he shouldered past a spider. Moto kept as close as he could, ignoring the pain as a spider's fangs raked down his back. As he ran, Moto pulled one of Seiko's spheres from his pouch.

They reached the center and Moto turned, pressing his back against Keta. He waited until the shapeling had the boy in his arms. "Hit me!"

Fire spread along Moto's back. It flared down his limbs and filled him with strength. It was almost too much to bear, like he was being burned from the inside out.

If he wanted to force the spiders away, he had to throw stones. But he couldn't sense his targets while attacking at the same time. So he did what Iruka taught him to. He changed his goal.

Moto reached out, broad like he was sensing. No need for precision if he grabbed hold of everything. Then, with fire coursing through his veins, he pulled the world inside himself.

Even reinforced by Keta's power, it felt like Moto was being ripped apart. The entire cave groaned and stuttered. A loud _crack_ sounded somewhere beneath his feet. Keta groaned involuntarily as we was pressed flat against Moto. Then four large, invisible masses were crashing through the air, out of control.

Moto released the pull before it really did rip him apart. He dropped Seiko's sphere. "Jump!"

Another wave of heat, this time outside Moto's body, as Keta wrapped his arm around Moto's waist. The world lurched as they shot towards the ceiling. A heavy crunch sounded as the spiders collided where Moto had been standing. Moto reached out and pulled the switch.

The spiders were visible for a fraction of a second before the explosion ripped through them.

The spiders absorbed most of the bomb snap's detonation, but a concussive wave of spider guts still crashed into them from below. Moto felt the boy jerk violently beside him. He looked over in alarm, afraid that shrapnel from the blast had struck the kid. But he seemed unhurt as he hung, limp and unconscious in Keta's arm.

Moto pulled against the ceiling to slow their fall. Keta absorbed the rest of the impact in a crouch. They stood in a small crater, covered in grime and their own blood. Laughing in disbelief, Keta pulled Moto close and kissed him. "Amazing!"

Moto gave himself a moment's enjoyment, then pulled back. "We're not out of the woods yet." He turned back toward the cavern entrance overhead, where the approaching sounds had reached a crescendo.

His body felt like it had been trampled by a horse. Every muscle felt like lead. Keta was tapped out too. If it was more jorogumo, he could try to pull a few off the wall. Maybe the fall would disable them. But then they would have to run.

Moto's heart sank as he watched a mob of black, alien legs curling around the edge of the cave. He reached up, getting ready to pull as many as he could, but before he could act he was hit by a heavy _whoomph_ as air was forced through the tunnel and into the cavern. The spiders at the entrance were thrown to the far wall, their bodies breaking against the far stone.

Fumi came racing after them, swan diving through the entrance. She did a flip in the air and landed in a crouch, air rushing out around her to cushion the fall. "Don't worry. I'll take it from here." She paused for effect, then stood and looked around. She seemed to deflate as she saw the dead spiders littering the floor. "Oh, never mind."

Keta gave her a kind look. "It was a wonderful entrance, at least."

"Hey! You kids got the smaller kid?" Iruka stood at the ledge, shouting to them over her shoulder. The blade snap whirred around her body as she shot it back into the tunnel repeatedly. "Great. Instead of showing off how about we get out of here?"

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

Moto and Keta landed in the hallway at the top of the cavern with the help of a pull from Iruka. Fumi landed indelicately beside them with a blast of wind.

The hallway was littered with the shredded bodies of jorogumo. Some had been crushed against walls by Fumi's wind, but it seemed most had been dissected. The blade snap continued to whir around Iruka's shoulders like a restless hummingbird as she looked them up and down. The sound of more spiders approaching filled the hallway.

"How are you two doing?"

"Both our resonances are pretty exhausted. I might have a little bit left in me but Keta is tapped. Otherwise we're fine."

Iruka raised an eyebrow at that last part. "At the risk of repeating myself, you look like garbage, kid. We need to update your definition of fine. The two of you stay at the back for now and let me and Fumi clear the way."

Keta stood straighter. "I am still--."

Iruka turned back toward the onrushing spiders. "As much as I would _love_ to sit here arguing the finer points of just how messed up your body really is right now, we kind of have more pressing concerns. You've done plenty to prove yourself. Time to trust the squad."

Keta nodded, accepting the feedback gracefully. He shifted the unconscious kid onto his back. "I will carry the child, then."

"Right. Stay close. Not that I'm giving you much choice." Iruka grinned as she launched forward. A heartbeat later, all three of them staggered forward as Iruka pulled them along behind her.

Moto adapted to Iruka's pull the fastest. He'd had practice gravity running, after all. But the others adjusted to the extended gait just a few steps after. Just in time for the next wave of spiders to hit.

There were so many, running along the floor and walls and ceiling, clambering over one another in the rush to attack. Moto couldn't tell where one jorogumo began and the others ended. There had been more spiders in that first cavern than he thought.

"Don't stop! We can't take them all so don't let them bog us down." Iruka's blade snap shot forward, slicing up one wall and back the other. Moto couldn't believe how many things she was focusing on at once. While she threw the weapon, she had to keep the blade spinning. And the whole time her pull against the three of them never faltered.

Fumi stepped up to Iruka's side and punched the air with both fists. A gust ripped over the floor, knocking spiders into the side wall and clearing a path. Then the spiders were around them.

Moto drew a dagger, pulling lightly in all directions to sense any spiders that got too close and driving them back with his blade. He kept an eye on Keta, but the shapeling wasn't having much trouble dodging the handful of spiders that made it past Iruka and Fumi uninjured.

Now that she was among the spiders, Iruka had caught the blade snap and was opting to slam the monsters into walls and each other. She wore an easy smile while she worked.

Fumi didn't look nearly as casual, but Moto had to admit her skills had improved since the last time he saw her fight. Her arms blurred as she made a small torrent of wind around them, picking up dust and rocks and focusing them into a saw blade. Her arms sliced through jorogumo like paper.

And then they were through. The monsters behind them turned, falling behind as Iruka pulled them forward. More sounds ahead suggested they weren't out of the woods yet. Moto kept his gravity sense on to catch any light spiders that might be trying to sneak up on them.

They reached the intersection and Iruka charged toward the exit. There was a loud clattering of stones as Keta planted his feet and held against the forward pull. Iruka came to a halt and turned with a question on her face.

"What's the matter?"

Keta was straining his eyes down the other tunnel, where the rest of the caravan had been. "Did you see anyone fleeing the cave as you entered?"

"What? No. Come on, we don't have time to stick around here." The spiders behind them were catching up.

Keta kept his feet planted, calling down the tunnel. There was a pause, followed by a muted response. Keta turned to the rest of the group. "There are still people here."

The spiders behind them came crashing around the corner, throwing themselves at Keta and the boy on his back. The shapeling crouched, dodging the first, but a second and a third slammed into him. He was thrown into the wall, desperately holding back the fangs of a spider. The boy fell to the floor several feet away.

Moto dove for the spider attacking Keta without thinking, burying his dagger in the side of its head as he shouldered it away. Another leapt through the air and Moto pulled from his foot to slam it into the ground. It bought Keta enough time to push off the wall and bring his foot down in a loud _crunch_ on the spider's head. The shapeling caught his breath and looked around.

"The kid!" Moto spun, scanning the floor. Spiders swarmed over the boy's body. But instead of biting him, they lifted his unconscious form, carrying it between several spiders as they moved back down the tunnel. Moto took a step forward but more spiders stepped in to fill the gap.

His heart sank. After all this, was the kid going to slip away? Were they going to fail?

Fumi came sprinting past, planting a foot against the wall and leaping over the front line of monsters. She yelled dramatically as she came down on the spiders carrying the boy. She sliced clean through one with her hand, planting it against the ground as she brought her foot around on the other spider like a scythe.

"Sorry Keta, we don't have time to wait around for more people." Iruka was doing her best to push back against the wave of spiders attacking from the front, but there were so many even she was being forced back. "They're on their own."

Keta snapped one of his wrist silks like a whip, cutting a spiders' legs out from under it. "I will not leave people!"

Iruka took another step back and the spiders finally rushed around the edges of the tunnel. If they didn't get out of here now, they were going to be overrun. But Keta stepped forward defiantly, determined to hold the spiders off. The sound of people running down the hallway started to get louder.

They were never going to convince Keta to leave those people behind. Especially not when they sounded so close. But how would they flee with that many more people in tow? Pressing their luck didn't just risk failing the mission. Their lives were at stake.

Moto didn't have a choice. He pulled against the ceiling, bringing a rock crashing into the back of Keta's head. Caught off guard, the shapeling crumpled to the ground. Moto caught him and pushed towards Iruka. "Let's go!"

She stared at him for moment, then nodded and dove into the spider filled tunnel. Moto hefted Keta over a shoulder and pulled out the shield snap with his free hand. He pulled it open and used it to hold off the snapping fangs as they stumbled forward.

Keta got heavier. Moto looked up and saw a spider that had landed on the shapeling. He watched as the the spider bit into Keta's side.

"I got you!" A blast of wind ripped the spider off of Moto's back as Fumi came into view. She had the young boy thrown over her shoulders and was stepping forward methodically, clearing the path with blasts from her feet.

As they neared the other side, Moto heard a commotion behind them. He turned in time to see some of the prisoners throwing themselves at the spiders in the rear, clawing desperately as they tried to catch up to Moto and his squad. The spiders turned and descended on them. It was short work.

The distraction bought them some breathing room, allowing them to push through to the other side. Iruka slowed enough to grab Keta off of Moto's shoulders and then began to pull them forward again.

"Last hurdle! Everybody get ready to jump."

Moto could see the end of the tunnel, opening onto the first chasm they traversed. Thin, black legs appeared over the edge. Moto pulled against the walls, accelerating as he leapt over the climbing spiders, following Iruka. He wobbled in the air, his resonance nearly exhausted, but he managed to land heavily on the far side of the chasm with Iruka's help.

He turned to see Fumi come up short, the spiders from the cavern blocking her way. They were holding her back, preventing her from getting a clean angle on the jump.

Moto braced himself against the wall. "Jump! I can help pull you."

Fumi looked up at him, then squared the boy on her shoulders and set her face. "It's OK, I can do it on my own!" She jumped, planting her foot against the side of the tunnel, then pushing off with a blast of wind and aiming for the wall of the cavern midway through.

It was going to be close. And her resonance had to be tiring out by this point as well. Moto didn't want to risk it. As Fumi connected with the far wall of the cavern, coiling to make her final jump, Moto pulled against her, giving her extra lift.

He pulled a fraction of a second early, causing Fumi's footing to slip. She regained her composure in time to get a blast of wind behind her, but the jump was awkward. Moto cursed, pulling as hard as he could. As tired as he was, it wasn't much.

Fumi hit the stone hard, landing half in the tunnel. Her legs dangled into the cavern. She scrambled for a handhold with one hand, trying to hang onto the kid with the other. Then Iruka turned and pulled her up.

"I said I had it! You nearly made me fall." Fumi glared at Moto.

"I didn't mess up your jump that much! You weren't going to make it without me."

They both slid across the stone as Iruka pulled them backwards. "We _seriously_ need to discuss what counts as appropriate mission chatter with all three of you. Get moving for the exit!"

Moto shot Fumi one last glare, then lifted Keta onto his shoulders. The shapeling was hot, his body twitching as the spider's venom coursed through him.

There was a loud crack and Moto's head whipped around. Iruka stood at the end of the tunnel with arms outstretched. The muscles on her neck stood out as she brought her arms toward her chest with great effort. There was another pop and the rock around her shifted. She jumped back as the tunnel began to collapse.

She turned, making straight for the exit. "Don't just stand there! I have no idea if this whole tunnel is coming down after that."

Moto turned with renewed energy, his legs pumping as he moved to the exit. Light began to pour in up ahead. He threw himself through the exit, staggering to the ground as a loud _thump_ sounded from deeper within. He rolled over onto his back, letting out a long sigh of relief as he stared at the sky. They made it.

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

They pushed as far into the woods as they could before they collapsed and made camp. It wasn't very far.

Neither the boy nor Keta had woken, but the shapeling continued to twitch. They tied him to a tree in case he woke up, then set to binding everyone's wounds.

Moto winced as he scrubbed his shoulder clean and rubbed ointment from his pouch into the wound, he kept one concerned eye on Keta. "Is he going to be OK?"

Aside from a bit of dirt, Iruka was unharmed. She tended to Keta's ragged arms. "He should be fine, so long as we can keep him from hurting himself until the venom runs its course."

Fumi looked at the ropes holding Keta in place. "Are those really going to hold him?"

"If his resonance has anything left to give, the metabolic boost will burn through the venom anyways. So the answer is either yes or it doesn't matter."

Fumi lowered herself to the ground and began putting together a fire. She did not use her usual burst of wind to cushion the fall, choosing to sit normally. So she had reached her limit too. Moto did his best to think back over the fight. How many times had they all used their powers? He filed the information away in case those limits were useful later.

As he ran through the events, Moto felt a growing sense of uncertainty. They had saved the kid, but only barely. This mission was crucial to his plans, yet he had taken a lot of risks. Unnecessary risks. When the spiders were attacking Keta and the boy, Moto hadn't hesitated to jump for Keta. He didn't even think of the kid.

Most confusing, Moto wasn't sure he had made a mistake.

Fumi looked up and met his eyes. "What're you staring at?"

"Oh, nothing. Just spacing out. I'm pretty beat."

"I'll say. What happened down there? I didn't see many spiders when I landed but both you and Keta were at your limits."

Moto recounted the events, describing the light spiders and their strange abilities.

"I've never heard anything like that before. You said the jorogumo _transformed_?"

Moto nodded. "I'm not sure they did it themselves, though. It seemed like the change hurt. Their bodies weren't in great shape afterwards." Moto looked at the boy, lying by the fire as Fumi tended to him. "And it only happened when the boy touched them."

"You think he had something to do with it?"

"I don't know. It sounds crazy, but it seemed like he had some connection with them. Whenever we killed a spider, the boy looked like it hurt him too. It was hard to tell, though, because he was flailing around like crazy. I think he was bitten. Should we tell his father?"

Iruka considered for a moment. "Probably best not to. People pay for Daggers when they don't want questions asked. The dad may know what's up with the kid or he might not, but I guarantee whichever way it goes he'd rather we pretend like we didn't see anything."

Fumi looked up from her ministrations. "Are you sure they attacked him? Where did you see him get bitten?"

"I didn't see it. Probably happened before we arrived. The kid had already lost it by the time we got there. Why?"

Fumi did one last pass over the boy. "Aside from a few bruises and scrapes from when we were carrying him out, the kid doesn't have a scratch on him."

"That can't be right. He seemed mad when we approached him. And the spiders were all over him at the end, why wouldn't they bite?"

Fumi shrugged. "All I know is there's no spider bites. Maybe it was just shock?"

There was a faint rustle as Keta began to stir against the tree, his eyes flickering. Everyone tensed and watched, waiting to see how the shapeling would react.

Keta's eyes snapped open and he began to strain against the ropes desperately, his feet scrambling for purchase along the ground. He groaned, his eyes white with fear. Moto took a step forward, his hand held out, but Iruka held him back.

"It's OK, kid. Nothing you can do right now but let it pass. It shouldn't take more than an hour. But right now getting close is only going to stress him worse."

"I should have been paying more attention as we ran. I knocked him out, it was my responsibility."

Iruka hesitated. "You did what you thought you had to, and made the best of the situation after that. Those kind of decisions are a part of life now. If you beat yourself up over every one, you'll go crazy."

Fumi stepped up beside them, looking down at Keta as he continued to pull against his ropes. "He's not going to be happy when he hears how things went down."

A pit formed in Moto's stomach as he thought about that conversation. "We don't have to tell him. We could say the prisoners made it out. A falling rock knocked him unconscious but we managed to pull everyone out and they went their separate ways."

Iruka shook her head adamantly. "You can tell him what you want about how he got knocked out. That's between you two. But he needs to know what happened to the others."

"Why, though? It's only going to hurt him."

"If he thinks it all worked out in the end, he'll take a crazy risk like that again. That's fine if he's making a calculated choice, but not if he's blind about the chances. Rose colored glasses are the fastest route to winding up dead."

Iruka turned to look at them. Her eyes rested primarily on Moto. "Overall, this went pretty well. Way harder than a first contract usually is, but you all adapted and made solid choices under pressure. But if this were an exam, I would fail you all."

Moto blinked. "What for?"

"You can _not_ be debating priorities in the middle of a mission like that. I'm not saying Keta was wrong to want to save those people. Or that you were wrong for stopping him. What's wrong is that you two didn't agree and we couldn't act decisively. That left us down a man and fighting off the back foot. More than anything, I want you to tell Keta what happened so you're forced to talk about how you'll handle a situation like that in the future."

There was a crash in the woods behind them, causing them all to turn and reach for weapons. The kid was up and away from the fire. They saw his back as he went crashing through the underbrush.

Moto pulled the tangle snap from his belt, then realized he didn't have the energy left to use it. He took a step forward, but came up short as the kid snapped backward and started flying through the air toward Iruka. She brought him into her arms and held him in place as the boy struggled.

"Get away! They're gonna hurt me! I need to run!" The kid struggled in vain against Iruka's strong arms. She shushed him gently.

"It's OK, we're safe. The spiders are gone. They can't hurt you anymore."

The kid turned his head wildly, straining backwards. "They took the light. Made it dark. Took me away. Let go!"

Iruka continued to soothe him as she walked to the fire. "Hey, hey, everything is OK now." She pointed his head towards the fire. "See? No more dark. Plenty of light."

The boy calmed a bit as he looked at the fire, his fit subsiding into a background of faint twitches and muttering.

"That's right. We're not going to hurt you. We're here to save you."

The boy relaxed into Iruka's arms and she left his hands free so he could warm them by the fire. "You're not gonna let them hurt me anymore?"

Everyone but Iruka sat in a small room inside the Bloodhall. The boy, whose name was Kashi, sat nervously in the corner of the room, picking at the new robes he wore. Soundstealer stood, leaning against the wall. It was the first time they had seen him since he gave the mission.

"You have done well." He addressed Fumi. "Was there anything out of the ordinary?" Soundstealer's gaze traveled over the group lazily.

Remembering Iruka's suggestion to play dumb, Moto spoke up before the others could reply. "Not really, sir. He was lucky not to be bitten, that made the extraction much easier."

Soundstealer watched him for a moment, his eyes probing. He held the stare just long enough to make Moto uncomfortable, then nodded.

Fumi let out a sigh and patted her hands on her thighs, cutting through the tension. "So, one mission down. When do you think we can get another?"

Soundstealer turned back to his daughter. "Whenever you've formed another squad, you may take another mission."

"What do you mean? We already have a squad."

Soundstealer shook his head. "I have told you this, daughter. Familiarity breeds attachment. Attachments to the other houses will weaken your resonance. You must pick a new squad."

Fumi bristled. "I don't _want_ a new squad. I can be strong and still have friends."

"I will offer no contract if you insist on keeping this group."

"But we're the strongest new recruits! This is the best squad."

Soundstealer scoffed. "What does it matter who is the strongest squad of children? Your ultimate strength is more important."

"Fine! We don't need your contracts anyways. We'll find our own."

Moto sat with his mouth slightly open. What just happened? They had succeeded. That was supposed to bring him closer to Soundstealer. But just like that it was falling away.

Moto looked to Keta, wondering how the shapeling would react to the conversation. His eyes were down, his hand on his chin thoughtfully. Keta had been quiet since he heard what happened to the prisoners.

A knock came at the far door, interrupting everyone's thoughts. Moto started to stand, but Soundstealer held out a hand. "That is unnecessary. I will take the boy inside and finalize the contract."

The boy gave one last nervous look over his shoulder before Soundstealer led him inside and closed the door. As soon as he was out of sight Fumi turned to them. "Ignore him, guys. He can't be stubborn forever. We just need to prove him wrong. Eventually we're going to be so strong he'll be begging for us to help on contracts just like every other master."

Moto grunted noncommittally. He thought getting close to Fumi was a good way to get close to Soundstealer as well. But it seemed like the two were at odds. He needed to reconsider his plans.

A few moments later Soundstealer walked from the room alone, folding the contract and placing it in his robe.

Moto nodded towards the paper. "Doesn't one of us need to sign that?"

"Unnecessary. I signed it myself."

Fumi bounced forward, earlier confrontation momentarily forgotten. "Can we at least see it? My first contract!"

Soundstealer finished stowing the contract hastily and made his way for the door. "Control yourself, daughter. This is nothing to be excited about."

Weird. Why didn't he want them to see the contract? They already knew the contents. Unless there was something on the final contract that he didn't want them to see. Moto pushed his bag beneath his chair as he stood, leaving the room without it.

As they neared the exit, Moto slowed. "Ah! I forgot my bag. One second, let me go grab it." He turned and ran back up the stairs before anyone could suggest otherwise.

Moto returned to the room and scooped up his bag. He looked around, then brought his ear to the door that Soundstealer entered before. Silent. He eased open the door and slipped inside. He moved fast, knowing he didn't have much time before Soundstealer would get suspicious.

On the desk was a stack of thick papers in case contracts needed to be updated or amended. Writing utensils sat beside the papers. Moto grabbed a stick of charcoal and rubbed it lightly across the top sheet. Faint white lines appeared where the page above had been written on. Moto read the first line he had rubbed.

__boy to be retrieved and returned to Jidoka unharmed. Soundstealer to__

He smiled, snatching the paper and tucking it into his bag, then made his way out of the room and back down the stairs. If Soundstealer wasn't going to give them more missions, Moto would learn more about his clients by himself.
