The child's scream cut off, disappearing so suddenly it felt like missing a step. The pained cry echoed off the walls before fading into silence.

Moto and Keta locked eyes. "Do you think that was--?"

They winced as an entire den full of spiders screeched in response. The sound stabbed at their ears, so high-pitched it was almost inaudible. It wasn't long before they would hear the chaotic drum line of countless spider legs racing towards them.

"The kid! We've got to get to him before anything happens."

Keta nodded, then turned to the people he had freed from the webs. "We must go now. Hide here until you hear fighting, then run."

Moto and Keta ran from the room without waiting to see how the prisoners reacted. They already took a huge risk rescuing them from the spiders in the first place. It was up to them to handle the rest.

Moto pulled the shutter all the way open on the lantern as they raced down the hallway. Their footsteps rang out against the stone as they worked their way back to the intersection. There was a loud snap as Keta crashed through one of the web trip wires stretched across the hall. No time left for caution.

They hit the spiders fast and quiet, just like he planned. It didn't seem like they gave away any kind of sign. Did a spider escape? No. The scream started the instant the light spider died. The timing was too perfect to be a coincidence. Somehow the other spiders knew when it died. This was revenge. They never should have interfered with the other prisoners.

He pushed the thought aside. There would be time for berating himself later. Now they had to focus.

Keta slid to a halt at the intersection they passed through earlier. He looked down the tunnel to the right, towards the exit. The sound of skittering legs bounced down the hallway like a thousand dice being tossed to decide their fate.

"I could collapse the tunnel." Keta balled his hand into a fist.

Moto grabbed his wrist. "No. We don't know what to expect further in. We may need Iruka and Fumi's help down there more than we need them to handle the spiders at the front."

They continued left, their strides lengthening nearly out of control as the tunnel turned down sharply. Moto pulled on the walls and floor behind him to keep from falling forward. Keta's steps looked as much like leaping and falling as they did like running.

They took a sharp corner at full speed, Moto pulling against the inside wall and swinging around like a stone in a sling. Keta let his momentum carry him up the outside wall of the turn, diving off the stone into a forward roll in order to change direction.

On the other side of the bend, the way was completely blocked with webs. At the speed they were moving, there was no time to stop. Moto threw his arms over his face and pulled on the walls in front of him. His body accelerated as he tried to punch through.

He felt the stuttering pull of webs clinging then breaking under his momentum. He was slowing at an alarming rate. There was a sharp tug against his shoulder as a web finally managed to hold, spinning Moto around.

He barely had time to realize he was stuck before Keta crashed into him, arms wrapping around Moto's waist. There was a final lurch as the webs gave way and then they were falling through the air.

They kept falling. With a curse, Moto realized they had gone off another cliff. He pulled against the ceiling desperately, trying to stop their descent. But it had taken him too long to act. He wasn't strong enough to catch their full weight this far from the ceiling. All he could do was soften the blow.

They landed hard. Air shot out of Moto's lungs in a ragged wheeze as he took the brunt of the impact beneath Keta. His head cracked against stone and swirls of light danced across his vision. Keta bounced off of Moto, landing heavily a few feet away.

Moto groaned weakly, panic taking his mind as he tried and failed to breathe. He rocked onto his side and vomited. A sharp pain in his side told him at least one rib was broken.

Focus. Moto gritted his teeth and pressed himself into a sitting position. He shook his head to clear it, but that only set his vision spinning worse. He pressed his back against the rough stone wall and staggered to his feet.

They were standing at the bottom of another pit. Smooth floor and grooves running up the walls suggested running water had carved it originally. A flickering light filled the room, sending shadows dancing and spinning across the walls. Their lantern had cracked open from the fall, igniting a large patch of webbing near the edge of the cavern. The shifting shapes heightened Moto's instability.

A few feet ahead, Keta remained prone. The shapeling struggled against a patch of webbing that stretched across the ground and held him fast. Moto took an unsteady step forward.

"S-Stay away!"

The whimpering voice drew Moto's attention further into the cavern. A young boy was scrambling backwards across the stone, one hand held to his head. The boy's clothes were ripped and badly worn. His hands were black with dirt and dried blood, and his short black hair was plastered to his head with grime.

Swarming around the boy was a herd of jorogumo. The boy hardly noticed them as they skittered across his hands and legs, his gaze remaining fixed on Moto and Keta. He must have been bitten.

Moto turned his attention back to Keta. He needed to get his friend free before those spiders reached him. But before he could move forward, the webbing around Keta shook violently. The shapeling cried out as a large gash opened along his shoulder.

There was a hiss of steam as Keta ripped his other arm free from the web and lashed out at the air. His hand stuttered as it connected with substance. Moto's vision flickered as a giant light spider resolved itself out of thin air. It hissed as it pulled back from Keta's blow, preparing to strike again.

Moto cursed, he took two drunken steps forward, swaying wildly. There was no way he could make it to Keta in his current condition. He grabbed a stone from behind and launched it toward the spider. The world tilted beneath him as he tried to aim and the rock went wide. It crashed into the ground at the boy's feet, shattering.

The boy cried out in pain as shrapnel shot past, scoring deep wounds in his arms. He screamed again, his eyes wide and staring as he reached out to the spiders swarming around him.

There was a blinding flash of light, many times brighter than the appearance of the light spider. Moto heard the spiders screeching, crying out as if being ripped apart.

When the light faded, the boy was lying unconscious amongst a pile of broken spiders. But the spiders weren't dead. Their bodies twitched across the ground as their skin stretched and ripped. Their forms grew grotesquely as they squealed in pain. A white glow emanated from the rents in their skin.

Slowly, five new light spiders pulled themselves from the ground. They hissed at Moto and Keta, who struggled with the light spider attacking him. Then they vanished.

<br />

<br />
<br />

Moto looked around in surprise. Without the spiders' light, there was nothing but the red glow of the spreading flames to light the room.

Could the spiders teleport? Moto took another breath, willing himself to think. No. The webbing around Keta had moved before the spider appeared. The spiders were still here. Just invisible.

Keta groaned with exertion, bringing Moto's attention back. The shapeling had pulled both arms free and was holding back the light spider's head as its fangs snapped at his neck. They seemed to be at an impasse for a moment, before Keta's arms flexed and he crushed the spiders' head between his hands. As it fell limp to the ground, the boy twitched at the center of the room.

Keta was still struggling to free himself from the web. Moto reached forward and pulled with his power. The sudden shift in weight made Moto stagger forward, almost taking him off his feet. He held the wall to steady himself as Keta finally tore himself free and ran to his side.

Moto looked around, trying to form a plan. They couldn't track the spiders by the sound of their movements. Echoes from the walls made it impossible to tell the creatures' location. The stone floor prevented any telltale footprints. He strained his eyes against the darkness, looking for shadows. Whatever the creatures' ability was, it seemed to block any visual trace of their presence.

His balance was still shifting beneath him, making it impossible to use his power precisely. If he couldn't aim, he'd just have to use another tact. Moto pulled against the scattering of stones behind him and sent a scattershot through the room. There was a rocky clatter as most of the missiles struck the far wall, but a few stopped dead in the air, bouncing off the invisible spiders.

Moto cursed. With his back this close to the wall he couldn't get any sort of acceleration on his shots. But if they moved away from the wall they could be surrounded.

Light flared in front of Moto as a spider appeared, fangs bared. Moto pressed back against the wall and lashed out with his dagger. How had it avoided his scattershot?

Moto spun wildly as his dagger passed through thin air. The spider's shape flickered, then reformed. An illusion? There was a hiss to his right as another spider appeared, lunging toward him as he regained his balance.

There was a meaty _crack_ as Keta unfurled the weighted silks around his wrists and brought both down on the attacking spiders' face in an overhead swing. The spider screeched as it pulled back and disappeared. But a direct hit from Keta should have completely caved its head in.

Moto glanced at Keta. The shapeling was breathing heavily beside him, the wound on his shoulder still bleeding.

"Are you too tired to pull fire?"

Before he could answer, another spider appeared, leaping through the air towards Keta. Moto reached out to pull the creature off course, but there was no substance to the image. Another illusion. Except, was there something behind it? Moto pushed further out and felt the weight of a real spider, flying behind the illusion.

"It's not there! Aim behind it!"

Keta changed the angle of his strike mid swing and brought one of his silks across the side of the creature, knocking it into the wall. Before it could regain its feet Keta swung his other silk down on its head. There was a sickening crunch and the spider lay twitching mindlessly. Four left.

Keta pulled back against Moto, scanning the darkness around them. "I still have some fire left, but I do not want to be defenseless if one of us is bitten again. I can handle these creatures naturally for now. How did you know where it was?"

"My power had no effect on the illusions, but I could feel the weight of the real one behind it. It doesn't seem like they can make the images very far from their real body."

Could he use that? He had caught the presence of the first spider by happenstance. He could test the illusions when they attacked, but his pulls were narrow and he wouldn't have much time to search around the image for the real thing. Unless...

Moto closed his eyes and softened his focus. He sent his power in a broad pulse. Pulling softly in all directions. He felt a faint pull from Keta beside him, then something more solid from the wall at his back. There was a flutter in front of them.

"In front of us!"

Keta swung out with his silks, cutting a low arc that broke a couple legs of an approaching spider. It staggered, but managed to keep its feet. The sense wasn't precise, but it was something.

"I can tell where they are, but I can't focus on anything else while I'm doing it..."

"That is enough. I will strike where you tell me." Keta stepped forward, placing himself between Moto and the spiders.

He could sense the general direction of enemies as they approached, but that wasn't enough to land hits that drove the creatures back. Anyone else would have been swinging wildly, hoping for an occasional lucky shot. But Keta's speed and control made it work.

Even without using his power, the shapeling was able to react in real-time, adjusting his blows mid swing as he responded to the weight of impact. When he landed a solid hit, he pounced immediately, lashing out with several more against the vulnerable foe.

But it didn't take long for the spiders to adjust their strategy. Realizing they couldn't rely solely on sneak attacks, they started attacking all at once. They would snap forward in a wave, then retreat back out of range.

Keta's body was soon covered in shallow gashes from narrowly dodged attacks. One of Moto's arms hung limply from a deep bite into the meat of his shoulder. At least the light spider transformation seemed to burn away the jorogumo's venom.

A chaotic wave of clicks and scrapes caught Moto's attention at the top of the cave, near the entrance. It was quiet at first. Hard to hear over the sounds of fighting. But it was growing louder. Reinforcements. But for who?

They needed to get to the boy. If it was more spiders, they would have to run. And if it was Fumi and Iruka, how would the light spiders react? They were focused on Moto and Keta now, while they had the upper hand. But if things looked bad, they might attack the kid to buy time for an escape.

But holding the light spiders off was hard enough while they only came from the front. If they moved to the center of the room, Keta couldn't cover every angle. Moto's balance had mostly returned, and the extra space would let him start throwing stones again. But using his power on offense would mean he couldn't detect the spiders.

If only Iruka was here. They needed two stone-bringers so they could use their gravity on offense and defense at the same time.

At the same time... Moto's eyes snapped open. "I've got a plan!"

Keta laughed between ragged breaths. "It is about time! I was beginning to think that you were slipping." He swung one of his yellow silks into the face of an onrushing spider at Moto's direction.

"It's going to take two bursts of energy from you. Do you have that?"

"Yes, but not much more. I won't be able to heal us anymore."

Moto looked briefly at the blood covering Keta's arms. The wound in his own shoulder was bad too. There wasn't any other choice. If they made it out, they could bind their wounds until Keta recovered enough to heal them.

"We'll have to take a risk then. On my mark we're going to charge toward the boy. We have to reach him. Ignore everything else. Once we get him, I need you to pump me up with one blast. Then when I say so, use the second burst to jump as high as you possibly can."

Keta nodded, no sign of doubt on his face. "I will be ready."

"As _high_ as you can. Go!"

Keta took off without hesitation, angling low as he ran. The shapeling's body rocked sideways as he shouldered past a spider. Moto kept as close as he could, ignoring the pain as a spider's fangs raked down his back. As he ran, Moto pulled one of Seiko's spheres from his pouch.

They reached the center and Moto turned, pressing his back against Keta. He waited until the shapeling had the boy in his arms. "Hit me!"

Fire spread along Moto's back. It flared down his limbs and filled him with strength. It was almost too much to bear, like he was being burned from the inside out.

If he wanted to force the spiders away, he had to throw stones. But he couldn't sense his targets while attacking at the same time. So he did what Iruka taught him to. He changed his goal.

Moto reached out, broad like he was sensing. No need for precision if he grabbed hold of everything. Then, with fire coursing through his veins, he pulled the world inside himself.

Even reinforced by Keta's power, it felt like Moto was being ripped apart. The entire cave groaned and stuttered. A loud _crack_ sounded somewhere beneath his feet. Keta groaned involuntarily as we was pressed flat against Moto. Four large, invisible masses were crashing through the air, out of control.

Moto released the pull before it really did rip him apart. He dropped Seiko's sphere. "Jump!"

Another wave of heat, this time outside Moto's body, as Keta wrapped his arm around Moto's waist. The world lurched as they shot towards the ceiling. A heavy crunch sounded as the spiders collided where Moto had been standing. Moto reached out and pulled the switch.

The spiders were visible for a fraction of a second before the explosion ripped through them.

The spiders absorbed most of the bomb snap's detonation, but a concussive wave of spider guts still crashed into them from below. Moto felt the boy jerk violently beside him. He looked over in alarm, afraid that shrapnel from the blast had struck the kid. But he seemed unhurt as he hung, limp and unconscious in Keta's arm.

Moto pulled against the ceiling to slow their fall. Keta absorbed the rest of the impact in a crouch. They stood in a small crater, covered in grime and their own blood. Laughing in disbelief, Keta pulled Moto close and kissed him. "Amazing! A stunning plan."

Moto gave himself a moment's enjoyment, then pulled back. "We're not out of the woods yet." He turned back toward the cavern entrance overhead, where the approaching sounds had reached a crescendo.

His body felt like it had been trampled by a horse. Every muscle felt like lead. Keta was tapped out too. If it was more jorogumo, he could try to pull a few off the wall. Maybe the fall would disable them. But then they would have to run.

Moto's heart sank as he watched a mob of black, alien legs curling around the edge of the cave. He reached up, getting ready to pull as many as he could, but before he could act he was hit by a heavy _whoomph_ as air was forced through the tunnel and into the cavern. The spiders at the entrance were thrown to the far wall, their bodies breaking against the far stone.

Fumi came racing after them, swan diving through the entrance. She did a flip in the air and landed in a crouch, air rushing out around her to cushion the fall. "Don't worry. I'll take it from here." She stood and looked around, then seemed to deflate as she saw the dead spiders littering the floor. "Oh, never mind."

Keta gave her a kind look. "It was a wonderful entrance, at least."

"Hey! You kids got the smaller kid?" Iruka stood at the ledge, shouting to them over her shoulder. The blade snap whirred around her body as she shot it back into the tunnel repeatedly. "Great. Instead of showing off how about we get out of here?"

<br />

---
<br />
<br />

Moto and Keta landed in the hallway at the top of the cavern with the help of Iruka's pull. Fumi landed delicately beside them with a blast of her own wind.

The hallway was littered with the shredded bodies of jorogumo. Some had been crushed against walls by Fumi's wind, but it seemed most had been dissected. The blade snap continued to whir around Iruka's shoulders like a restless hummingbird as she looked them up and down. The sound of more spiders approaching filled the hallway.

"How are you two doing?"

"Both our resonances are pretty exhausted. I might have a little bit left in me but Keta is tapped. Otherwise we're fine."

Iruka raised an eyebrow at that last part. "At the risk of repeating myself, you look like garbage, kid. We need to update your definition of fine. The two of you stay at the back for now and let me and Fumi clear the way."

Keta stood straighter. "I am still--."

Iruka turned back toward onrushing spiders. "As much as I would _love_ to sit here arguing the finer points of just how messed up your body really is right now, we kind of have more pressing concerns. You've done plenty to prove yourself. Time to trust the squad."

Keta nodded, accepting the feedback gracefully. He shifted the unconscious kid onto his back. "I will carry the child, then."

"Right. Stay close. Not that I'm giving you much choice." Iruka grinned as she launched forward. A heartbeat later, all three of them staggered forward as Iruka pulled them along behind her.

Moto adapted to Iruka's pull the fastest. He'd had practice gravity running, after all. But the others adjusted to the extended gait just a few steps after. Just in time for the next wave of spiders to hit.

There were so many, running along the floor and walls and ceiling, clambering over one another in the rush to attack. Moto couldn't tell where one jorogumo began and the others ended. There had been more spiders in that first cavern than Moto thought.

"Don't stop! We can't take them all so we can't let them bog us down." Iruka's blade snap shot forward, slicing up one wall and back the other. Moto couldn't believe how many things Iruka was focusing on at once. While she threw the weapon, she had to keep the blade spinning. And the whole time her pull against the three of them never faltered. And she had only had the new weapon for a few days.

Fumi stepped up to Iruka's side and punched the air with both fists. A gust ripped over the floor, knocking spiders into the side wall and clearing a path. Then the spiders were around them.

Moto drew a dagger, pulling broadly to sense any spiders that got too close and driving them back with the blade. He kept an eye on Keta, but the shapeling wasn't having much trouble dodging the handful of spiders that made it past Iruka and Fumi uninjured.

Now that she was among the spiders, Iruka had caught the blade snap and was opting to slam the monsters into walls and each other. She wore an easy smile while she worked.

Fumi didn't look nearly as casual, but Moto had to admit her skills had improved since the last time he saw he fight. Her arms blurred as she made a small torrent of wind around them, picking up dust and rocks and focusing them into a blade. Her arms sliced through jorogumo like paper.

And then they were through. The monsters behind them turned, falling behind as Iruka pulled them forward. More sounds ahead suggested they weren't out of the woods yet. Moto kept his gravity sense up as best he could, hoping to catch any light spiders that might be trying to sneak up on them.

They reached the intersection and Iruka charged forward toward the exit. There was a loud clattering of stones as Keta planted his feet and held against the forward pull. Iruka came to a halt and turned with a question on her face.

"What's the matter?"

Keta was straining his eyes down the other tunnel, where the rest of the caravan had been. "Did you see anyone fleeing the cave as you entered?"

"What? No. Come on, we don't have time to stick around here." The spiders behind them were catching up.

Keta kept his feet planted, calling down the tunnel. There was a pause, followed by a muted response. Keta turned to the rest of the group. "There are still people here."

The spiders behind them came crashing around the corner, throwing themselves at Keta and the boy on his back. The shapeling crouched, dodging the first, but a second and a third slammed into him. Keta was thrown into the wall, desperately holding back the fangs of a spider. The boy laid on the floor several feet away as spiders from both sides crashed down on them.

Moto dove for the spider attacking Keta, burying his dagger in the side of its head as he shouldered it away. Another leapt through the air and Moto pulled from his foot to slam it into the ground. It bought Keta enough time to push off the wall and bring his foot down in a loud _crunch_ on the spider's head. The shapeling caught his breath and looked around.

"The kid!" Moto spun around, scanning the floor. Spiders swarmed over the boy's body. But instead of biting him, they lifted his unconscious body, carrying it between several spiders as they began to move back down the tunnel. Moto took a step forward but more spiders stepped in to fill the gap.

Moto's heart sank. After all this, was the kid going to slip away? Were they going to fail?

Fumi came sprinting past, planting a foot against the wall and leaping over the front line of spiders. She yelled dramatically as she came down on the spiders carrying the boy. She sliced clean through one with her hand, planting it against the ground as she brought her foot around on the other spider like a scythe.

"Sorry Keta, we don't have time to wait around for more people." Iruka was doing her best to push back against the wave of spiders attacking from the front, but there were so many even she was being forced back. "They're on their own."

Keta snapped one of his wrist silks like a whip, cutting a spiders' legs out from under it. "I will not leave people!"

Iruka took another step back and the spiders finally rushed around the edges of the tunnel. If they didn't get out of here now, they were going to be overrun. But Keta stepped forward defiantly, determined to hold the spiders off. The sound of people running down the hallway started to get louder.

They were never going to convince Keta to leave those people behind. Not when it looked like there was a chance to save them. They sounded tantalizingly close. But how would they flee with that many more people in tow? Pressing their luck didn't just risk failing the mission. Their lives were at stake.

Moto didn't have a choice. He pulled against the ceiling, bringing a rock crashing into the back of Keta's head. Caught off guard, the shapeling crumpled to the ground. Moto caught him and pushed towards Iruka. "Let's go!"

She stared at him for moment, then nodded and dove into the spider filled tunnel. Moto hefted Keta over a shoulder and pulled out the shield snap with his free hand. He pulled it open and used it to hold off the snapping fangs as they stumbled forward.

Keta suddenly got heavier. Moto looked up at the spider that had landed on the shapeling, unable to strike at it. He watched as the the spider bit into Keta's side.

"I got you!" A blast of wind ripped the spider off of Moto's back as Fumi came into view. She had the boy thrown over her shoulders and was stepping forward methodically, clearing the path with blasts from her feet.

As they neared the other side, Moto heard a commotion behind them. He turned in time to see some of the prisoners throwing themselves at the spiders in the rear, clawing desperately as they tried to catch up to Moto and his squad. The spiders turned and descended on them. It was short work.

The distraction bought them some breathing room, allowing them to push through to the other side. Iruka slowed enough to grab Keta off of Moto's shoulders and then began to pull them forward again.

"Last hurdle! Everybody get ready to jump."

Moto could see the end of the tunnel, opening onto the first chasm they traversed. Thin, black legs appeared over the edge. Moto pulled against the walls, accelerating as he leapt over the climbing spiders, following Iruka. He wobbled in the air, his resonance nearly exhausted, but he managed to land heavily on the far side of the chasm.

He turned to see Fumi come up short, the spiders from the cavern blocking her way. They were holding her back, preventing her from getting a clean angle on the jump.

Moto braced himself against the wall. "Jump! I can help pull you."

Fumi looked up at him, then squared the boy on her shoulders and set her face. "It's OK, I can do it on my own." She jumped, planting her foot against the side of the tunnel, then pusing off with a blast of wind at an angle, aiming for the wall of the cavern midway through.

It was going to be close. And her resonance had to be tiring out by this point as well. Moto didn't want to risk it. As Fumi connected with the far wall of the cavern, coiling to make her final jump, Moto pulled against her, trying to give her extra lift.

He pulled a fraction of a second early, causing Fumi's footing to slip. She regained her composure in time to get a blast of wind behind her, but the jump was awkward. Moto cursed, pulling as hard as he could to try and get Fumi across the cavern. As tired as he was, it wasn't much.

Fumi hit the stone hard, landing half in the tunnel. Her legs dangled into the cavern. She scrambled for a handhold with one hand, trying to hang onto the kid with the other. Then Iruka turned and pulled her up.

"I said I had it! You nearly made me fall." Fumi glared at Moto.

"I didn't mess up your jump that much! You weren't going to make it without me."

They both slid across the stone as Iruka pulled them backwards. "We _seriously_ need to discuss what counts as appropriate mission chatter with all three of you. Get moving for the exit!"

Moto shot Fumi one last glare, then lifted Keta onto his shoulders. The shapeling was hot, his body twitching. The spider's venom was coursing through him. They needed to get out of the cave before Keta woke up and started attacking them.

There was a loud crack and Moto's head whipped around. Iruka stood at the end of the tunnel facing into the cavern with arms outstretched. The muscles on her neck stood out as she brought her arms toward her chest with great effort. There was another pop and the rock around her shifted. She jumped back as the tunnel began to collapse.

She turned, making straight for the exit. "Don't just stand there! I have no idea if this whole tunnel is coming down after that."

Moto turned with renewed energy, his legs pumping as he moved to the exit. Light began to pour in up ahead. He threw himself through the exit, staggering to the ground as a loud _thump_ sounded from deeper within. He rolled over onto his back, letting out a long sigh of relief as he stared at the sky. They made it.
