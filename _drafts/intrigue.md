The child's scream cut off, it's disappearance so sudden it felt like missing a step. The pained cry echoed off the walls hollowly, fading into silence.

Moto and Keta locked eyes. "Do you think that was--?"

They both grabbed their ears, wincing as an entire den full of spiders screeched in response to the scream. The sound stabbed at their ears, so high-pitched it was almost inaudible. It wasn't long before they would hear the chaotic drum line of countless spider legs racing towards them.

"The kid! We've got to get to him before anything happens."

Keta nodded, then turned to the people he had freed from the webs. "We must go now. Hide here until you hear fighting, then try to run."

Moto and Keta ran from the room without waiting to see how the prisoners reacted. They already took a huge risk rescuing them from the spiders in the first place. It was up to them to handle the rest.

Moto pulled the shutter all the way open on the lantern as they raced down the hallway. Their footsteps rang out against the stone as they worked their way back to the intersection. There was a loud snap as Keta crashed through one of the web trip wires stretched across the hall. No time left for caution.

They had hit the spiders fast and quiet, just like he planned. It didn't seem like they had given away any kind of sign. Did a spider escape? No. The scream started the instant the light spider died. The timing was too perfect to be a coincidence. Somehow the other spiders knew when it died. This was revenge.

They never should have interfered with the other prisoners. He pushed the thought aside. Time for berating himself later. Now they had to focus on getting to the kid.

Keta slid to a halt at the intersection they came through earlier. He looked down the tunnel to the right, towards the exit. Skittering legs bounced down the hallway like a thousand dice being tossed to decide their fate.

"I could buy us time by collapsing the tunnel." Keta balled his hand into a fist.

Moto grabbed his wrist. "No. We don't know what to expect further in. We may need Iruka and Fumi's help down there more than we need them to handle the spiders at the front."

They continued left, their strides lengthening nearly out of control as the tunnel turned down sharply. Moto pulled on the walls and floor behind him to keep from falling forward. Keta's steps looked as much like leaping and falling as they did like running.

They took a sharp corner at full speed, Moto pulling against the inside wall and swinging around like a stone in a sling. Keta let his momentum carry him up the outside wall of the turn, diving off the stone into a forward roll in order to change direction.

On the other side of the bend, the way was completely blocked with webs. At the speed they were moving, there was no time to stop. Moto threw his arms over his face and pulled on the walls in front of him. His body accelerated as he tried to punch through.

He felt the stuttering pull of webs clinging then breaking under his momentum as they slowed him at an alarming rate. There was a sharp tug against his shoulder as a web finally managed to hold, spinning Moto around bodily.

He barely had time to realize he was stuck before Keta crashed into him, arms wrapping around Moto's waist. There was a final lurch as the webs gave way and then they were falling through the air.

They kept falling. With a curse, Moto realized they had gone off another cliff. He pulled against the ceiling desperately, trying to stop their descent. But it had taken him too long to act. He wasn't strong enough to catch their full weight this far from the ceiling. All he could do was soften the blow.

They landed hard. Air shot out of Moto's lungs in a ragged wheeze as he took the brunt of the impact beneath Keta. His head cracked against stone and swirls of light danced across his vision. Keta bounced off of Moto, landing heavily a few feet away.

Moto groaned weakly, panicking taking his mind as he tried and failed to breathe. He rocked onto his side and vomited. A sharp pain in his side told him at least one rib was broken.

Focus. Moto gritted his teeth and pressed himself into a sitting position. He shook his head to clear it, but that only set his vision spinning worse. He pressed his back against the rough stone wall and staggered to his feet.

They were standing at the bottom of another pit. Smooth floor and grooves running up the walls suggested running water had carved it originally. A flickering light filled the room, sending shadows dancing and spinning across the walls. Their lantern had cracked open from the fall, igniting a large patch of webbing near the edge of the cavern. The shifting shapes heightened Moto's instability.

A few feet in ahead, Keta remained prone. The shapeling struggled against a patch of webbing that stretched across the ground and held him fast. Moto took an unsteady step forward.

"S-Stay away!"

The whimpering voice drew Moto's attention further into the cavern. A young boy was scrambling backwards across the stone, one hand held to his head. The boy's clothes were ripped and badly worn. His hands were black with dirt and dried blood, and his short black hair was plastered to his head with grime.

Swarming around the boy was a herd of Jorogumo. The boy hardly noticed them as they skittered across his hands and legs, his gaze remaining fixed on Moto and Keta. He must have been bitten.

Moto turned his attention back to Keta. He needed to get his friend free before those spiders reached him. But before he could move forward, the webbing around Keta shook violently. Keta cried out as a large gash opened along his shoulder.

There was a hiss of steam as Keta ripped his other arm free from the web and lashed out at the air. His hand stuttered as it connected with substance. Moto's vision flickered as a giant light spider resolved itself out of thin air. It hissed as it pulled back from Keta's blow, preparing to strike again.

Moto cursed, he took two drunken steps forward, swaying wildly. There was no way he could make it to Keta in his current condition. He grabbed a stone from behind and launched it toward the spider. The world tilted beneath him as he tried to aim and the rock went wide. It crashed into the ground at the boy's feet, shattering.

The boy cried out in pain as shrapnel shot past, scoring deep wounds in his arms. He screamed again, his mind lost to panic as he reached out to the spiders swarming around him.

There was a blinding flash of light, many times brighter than the appearance of the light spider. From within the light, Moto heard the spiders screeching, crying out as if being ripped apart.

When the light faded, the boy was lying unconscious amongst a pile of broken spiders. But the spiders weren't dead. Their bodies twitched across the ground as their skin stretched and ripped. Their forms grew grotesquely as they squealed in pain. A white glow emanated from the rents in their skin.

Slowly, five new light spiders pulled themselves from the ground. They hissed at Moto and Keta, who struggled with the light spider attacking him. Then they vanished.
