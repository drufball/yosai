"Let me get this straight. A _mountain_ tried to kill you? And the only thing it managed for the trouble was that little scrape on your arm?" Seiko cocked her head sideways, tangled, red hair dangling past her shoulder as she looked at the bandage on Keta's bicep. Her face expressed about as much belief as the arms crossed in front of her.

Keta sat on the ground, legs outstretched and leaning back on his long arms. He shrugged. Somehow the move looked graceful. "It was not a particularly fast mountain."

Moto laid on his back, his head in Keta's lap. "Don't forget the wind and the trees. They tried to kill you too." He was only half listening to the conversation. The rest of his attention was admiring the way the shapeling's face caught the afternoon sunlight. He was glad Keta was back.

Keta smiled as though remembering a fond childhood memory. "The wind was much faster."

Seiko threw up her hands. "I'll never understand you weirdos. That sounds like a _bad_ day. But look at him. Smiling like he won a toy at the fair."

"You're just mad he didn't bring you back some part of the monster to tinker with."

Seiko uncrossed her arms and flopped onto her back like a stocky, red-haired starfish. "Is it so much to ask? The Gearhouse doesn't trust me with _any_ fun toys."

Keta's eyes scrunched closed as he laughed. "It has been how many walls that you've blown out since we met? Three?"

"Only two! The third one was before Moto and I met." She was a sulking starfish now.

Keta ran a hand through Moto's hair. He frowned and looked down at Moto. "What is this? Your hair is like a bird's nest." He pulled his hand free and his frown deepened. "A greasy bird's nest." He wiped his hand discreetly on the grass.

"What do you expect? Iruka's got me working so hard outside class, how am I supposed to find time to bathe regularly?"

"He's got a point. Baths are for lazy people." Seiko plucked a stick from the ground and used it to pick at a knot in her own hair.

Keta sighed and shook his head, his immaculately combed hair swaying behind him.

Before he could protest any further, a shadow stretched across him from behind. Moto felt a surge of heat pour off Keta's body as his hand shot up and blocked the open hand flying towards his face.

"Damn! I thought I had you." Fumi walked around and threw herself to the ground in front of them. A burst of wind cushioned her as she fell.

Seiko spluttered, wiping at her face as she sat up. "Bleh!" She wiped at her tongue. "You got dirt in my mouth! Honestly, doesn't anybody ever teach you Daggers about manners?"

Fumi looked chastened. "Whoops! Sorry."

Moto sat up as Fumi came into view. He caught himself as his body tensed, forcing his shoulders to relax. He needed to be more social if he wanted to get closer to Soundstealer. "Don't mind her, she just enjoys the opportunity to be snarky."

Fumi hesitated for a moment, weighing the odds before she threw out a joke. "I wondered why anyone was hanging out with you. I guess even prickly people gravitate to their own kind, eh?" Moto had never seen someone so tense after telling a joke. Was she holding her breath?

It turned out to be warranted, since he still prickled in response. Moto forced himself to ignore his petulant reaction and stuck his tongue out instead. Fumi relaxed visibly.

Keta looked back and forth between them. "You are friends now? I was only gone a few weeks!"

"_Provisional_ friends, if she keeps pushing her luck." Moto kept his voice light.

"Even so." Keta turned to Fumi and smiled warmly. "I am glad that you were able to look past the fact that Moto nearly killed you twice." Moto and Fumi both laughed awkwardly. "Ah, too soon for such jokes? Perhaps later."

Seiko cleared her throat.

"Oh, right! Sorry again. My name is Fumi." Fumi held her hand out to Seiko. The glimmer woman shook it, her red eyes stern.

"Seiko. I work in the Gearhouse."

"Nice to meet you Seiko. So what were you all talking about?"

"Keta was just telling us about the mission he got back from yesterday. And how he didn't bother bringing me any exciting souvenirs."

"Oh! How was it?" Fumi's eyes lit up and she leaned forward expectantly. "What kind of mission was it?"

"It was very simple. One of the Woodheart's nature spirits made its home near a village and was attacking the farmers and hunters when they went outside the walls. We were hired to take care of it."

Fumi sucked air through her teeth and groaned. "Oh man. A nature spirit! Ripping holes in the earth, creating whirlwinds. What a cool first mission! I bet the fight looked awesome. Sure would've loved to go on that." She shot Moto a look.

"Yes, it was rather impressive. All the rubble gave me an excellent stage to perform. Though sadly there was no one to watch except the other Daggers. I did learn a few new tricks from the squad leader, though."

Seiko rolled her eyes. "Crazy people."

Fumi wrestled her jealousy into submission and then continued. "Well, speaking of missions, I've got another one if you're ready."

Moto perked up. "You found a good one?"

"Well, I haven't necessarily found one, but I convinced my dad to let us take one of his lower offers. I came over to get you two so we could go take a look."

Keta held up a hand. "What are we talking about?"

Moto's stomach was a mix of excitement and anxiety. This was one step closer, with all that entailed. "Iruka says I'm ready for a mission. Fumi and I figured the three of us could form a squad."

Fumi nodded. "We _are_ the top three new recruits. Teaming up is a good way to get the senior Daggers' attention. And I convinced my dad that the three of us are strong enough to take on one of his contracts."

"Apparently Soundstealer gets a stream of contracts directed especially to him. Fumi had the idea that we could look through the contracts that he wasn't interested in. They're bound to be higher quality than the scraps that normally get handed to new recruits at the Bloodhall."

"This mission would be a greater challenge? I'm in. You two will need a teammate with experience to look after you, anyways. And to make sure you properly bathe."

Moto rolled his eyes, but Fumi took the bait. "You just wait! I've learned some new tricks of my own. If you're not careful, you'll get left behind." The two locked locked eyes and smiled. Competitively.

"Weirdos." Seiko stood and brushed dirt from her legs. "Well, if you three are heading out then I'll get back to work. _Without_ any new toys."

Keta stood and hugged the woman. "I will remember next time."

"Yeah, yeah, yeah." Moto stood and Seiko clasped his wrist in farewell. Her grip was strong and calloused. "By the way, Moto, I was thinking about your training with Iruka and I had an idea for some pretty sweet weapons for the two of you. Stop by and pick them up before you leave."

"Oh. That's awesome, thank you. I'll swing by." Moto watched Seiko walk away, wondering if she was hoping to get something in return. Maybe just an investment, hoping they would bring her interesting materials from their missions.

He turned back to the other two. "Speaking of Iruka, should we grab her before we head over to Zephys and look at contracts?"

Fumi shook her head. "I ran into her on the way here and asked. She said she was busy."

After the records he had seen in the Bloodhall, Moto wasn't surprised. Something had to have happened between Iruka and Soundstealer to break up their squad. Maybe she could be a future ally in Moto's plans.

Moto filed the thought away for another time and the three set out for Soundstealer's home.

The three of them stepped out of the rail cart onto the Zephys spire. After a few months, Moto had accepted his fate riding in the metallic carts as they rattled along the spiderwebs of railway connecting the Spires of Iga. That didn't mean he enjoyed looking over the edge as the cart careened over clouds and drops into oblivion.

Fumi watched Moto as they walked up the slope to Zephys. "Why do you look so green?"

"The rail carts make him uncomfortable. He is afraid of heights." Keta rubbed Moto's back.

"What! You can control gravity. Why would you be scared of heights?"

"I'm not scared of heights! Not normal heights anyways. But _ridiculous_ heights like riding a little box out into the clouds with a mile drop beneath me... I've been able to control gravity for a few months. I've been _falling_ for 19 years. It takes a while for my brain to catch up."

"I don't see what the big deal is." Fumi turned and continued up the spire with a carefree step. Moto wondered if solid ground would create a similar effect on Fumi as the spires did on him.

The buildings on Zephys spire were more distributed than any of the other Iga houses. They had only hiked a hundred feet up the mountain before Moto started to see isolated huts and platforms cut into the stone, positioned to catch the strong mountain gusts from every side.

Seniority seemed to buy you a higher position on the mountain, with the Daggers looking older as they hiked towards the top. They also got surlier. About halfway up, Moto and Keta started getting looks from anyone they passed.

"Have we done something wrong?" Keta had noticed the looks as well.

"Hm?" Fumi looked over her shoulder as she continued walking up the trail.

"Everyone is staring at us."

Fumi waved a hand. "It's nothing. They're probably just surprised to see non-Zephys Daggers this high up the mountain."

Moto took a step closer to Keta and kept his eyes on the people around them.

Moto heard Soundstealer's home before he saw it. A chaotic mix of jingling chimes and bells, undercut by an incessant whine, emanated from above as they scrambled over the final hurdle of rocks.

Soundstealer's home was, unsurprisingly, at the top of the mountain. It was a narrow, vertical structure that almost looked like an extension of the spire. The building was three stories, with balconies wrapping around each level.

The entire building was festooned with instruments that clattered in the wind or channeled it into tunnels like horns.

They reached the front door and a guard barred their path. "My lord, who are these people you've brought with you?"

"They're my new squad." Fumi tried to step past the man but the remained in her way.

"Why are they here?"

"Does it matter? They're not a threat. Let us through."

The guard did not seem dissuaded. "You know the master's feelings about unexpected guests."

Fumi stamped her foot at the man. "I've already talked to my dad. He gave us permission to come here and look at contracts. Now _let us through_. I won't have them saying Soundstealers mistreat their guests."

The guard stared at Fumi for a moment longer before his resolve broke and he stepped aside to let the group through.

As soon as they crossed the threshold, Moto was slapped in the face with silence. The door behind them was still open, but the cacophony of sounds made by the wind-blown instruments seemed unable to penetrate the building.

"Sorry about that, guys." Fumi turned to face them, her cheeks flushed as she rubbed the back of her head. "Dad's a bit-- What? Why are you both looking around like that?"

Moto rubbed a finger in his ear. "The sound of the chimes outside completely stopped. Is that normal?"

"Yeah, it just means dad's home." Fumi made a face. "It sucks when he's gone on long missions, the inner rooms are the only place you can get any peace." Fumi turned and bounced down a hallway before Moto or Keta could ask more.

Once he got over the initial surprise, Moto surveyed the house. He made an effort to memorize as much of the layout as he could, noting stairways, windows, and guard positions. He noticed with dismay that nearly every floorboard was a nightingale. It was impossible to move without making noise.

The entire building seemed like one giant training space. The walls were covered with weapons, well-worn with use. Floors were littered with sparring dummies or small terrain articles. Moto suddenly didn't feel so bad about his extra training sessions with Iruka. Being at the top didn't seem to allow room for anything else.

They came to a room that was filled with paper. Stacks of it covered several tables, accompanied by ink pots and sealing wax. Sitting amongst the neatly ordered stacks, working through a pile in front of him, was an older man with a bald head, hunched back, and thick spectacles.

"Toru!" Fumi skipped towards the old man like a small child. He looked up at her approach and smiled. "Do you have the contracts ready?"

"Ah yes. I was just putting together what I thought were the best options." Toru's voice quavered in time with his hand as he passed a stack of papers across the table.

Fumi snatched the papers greedily and began flipping through them. Her frown deepened as she flipped through the stack. "These are all assassination contracts, Toru."

"Yes mistress, that is your father's specialty."

"It's not mine, though. I asked for no killing."

Toru began to squirm. "Well, yes mistress. But I thought perhaps when you saw these you might reconsider..."

"I don't want to reconsider. Nobody _likes_ assassins! I want cool, inspiring missions. Like all the Heroes in the Tournament."

"But mistress, assassination contracts pay much better. And there are far more of them..." The discussion was taking on the tone of a well-worn trail.

"For now! We just need to show people that they can come to the Daggers with more than just their dirty work." A _very_ well-worn trail.

Moto felt a hand rest against his shoulder as a deep voice unfolded behind him like silk. "In this case, daughter, your eccentric ideas may dovetail nicely with my goals."

Moto felt blood slam through his veins as his body cranked into high alert. He spun, crouching and reaching for a dagger at his belt before he even processed what was going on. He hadn't heard even the hint of a sound behind him. How had someone gotten this close?

Behind him was a tall man that rippled with muscle. His long black hair was held in a knot on top of his head. He did not wear the usual Dagger uniform, instead opting for a sleeveless vest and loose pants. His hands and forearms were wrapped in cloth and covered in small bells.

As Moto reached for his dagger reflexively, Soundstealer spared him a sideways glance that dismissed the threat completely. Moto's forced his hand to freeze.

Keta's reaction was less restrained.

There was a wave of steam as the shapeling pulled heat into his body and twisted, aiming a roundhouse kick at Soundstealer's head. Even at Keta's full speed, Soundstealer leaned back casually, dodging the blow as he brought his palm up and hit Keta with a tight pulse of wind. Keta took the blow on the chest and back flipped to absorb the momentum.

The entire exchange was completely silent. Not quiet. Devoid of sound.

Keta straightened and relaxed his body. "You caught me off guard."

"Yes, that was the point. Your lack of hesitation is admirable, but you should have aimed for my knees. Not as flashy, but harder to dodge." Soundstealer's face and voice remained impassive as he spoke.

"Dad! Why can't you just welcome guests like a normal human being?"

Soundstealer ignored the question. "Why have you brought these two here?"

"They came to look at contracts, like we talked about, remember?"

Moto struggled to follow the conversation with his pulse beating in his ears. His hand still remained on his dagger. This was the man who had killed his family. His entire village. Standing no more than two feet away. He could strike now. Or could he? Soundstealer had swatted Keta away like an annoying fly.

"I did not think you would bring them directly into our home. I have told you to keep inter house fraternization to a minimum outside of what is needed on missions. You do not wish to weaken your resonance, do you?"

"No, but--."

"Then do not bring these distractions here again."

Soundstealer wasn't doing anything threatening. He didn't even sound hostile. But something about his presence put Moto on edge. Even without his obvious reasons to hate Soundstealer, Moto felt like he would have been uncomfortable around the man. Keta seemed similarly unsettled.

Soundstealer pulled a small, rolled up parchment from his belt and tossed it to Fumi. "This is your mission. I believe it should satisfy your requirements. It's a rescue mission. Very 'heroic'. And no killing. It's useless to me, save that the requester is a very important client."

Fumi unrolled the contract and summarized it for Keta and Moto. "A wealthy merchant was bringing his family from Matsuri to his new home in Jidoka when the convoy was attacked by monsters. They took the merchant's youngest son prisoner. We find their lair and get the kid back." Fumi rolled up the contract and nodded to her father.

"Good. Now escort these two out of the building and come upstairs for training." Soundstealer turned and walked from the room.

Fumi escorted them outside, offering her apologies. "He'll warm up after we do a couple missions. He's just a bit standoffish at first." She shut the door and left them standing outside amidst the din of wind chimes surrounding the house.

"Well, I guess she takes more after her mom. Something about that guy gave me the creeps."

Keta nodded. "He is like a ghost, moving through the world but not existing in it."

"Yeah, do you think Fumi can kill sound the same way?"

"It was not just sound. When my foot passed by him, it did not even stir up a small breeze. The air felt completely dead around him."
