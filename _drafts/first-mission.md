"Let me get this straight. A _mountain_ tried to kill you? And the only thing it managed for the trouble was that little scrape on your arm?" Seiko cocked her head sideways, tangled, red hair dangling past her shoulder as she looked at the bandage on Keta's bicep. Her face expressed about as much belief as the arms crossed in front of her.

Keta sat on the ground, legs outstretched and leaning back on his long arms. He shrugged. Somehow the move looked graceful. "It was not a particularly fast mountain."

Moto laid on his back, his head in Keta's lap. "Don't forget the wind and the trees. They tried to kill you too." He was only half listening to the conversation. The rest of his attention was admiring the way the shapeling's face caught the afternoon sunlight. He was glad Keta was back.

Keta smiled as though remembering a fond childhood memory. "The wind was much faster."

Seiko threw up her hands. "I'll never understand you weirdos. That sounds like a _bad_ day. But look at him. Smiling like he won a toy at the fair."

"You're just mad he didn't bring you back some part of the monster to tinker with."

Seiko uncrossed her arms and flopped onto her back like a stocky, red-haired starfish. "Is it so much to ask? The Gearhouse doesn't trust me with _any_ fun toys."

Keta's eyes scrunched closed as he laughed. "It has been how many walls that you've blown out since we met? Three?"

"Only two! The third one was before Moto and I met." She was a sulking starfish now.

Keta ran a hand through Moto's hair. He frowned and looked down at Moto. "What is this? Your hair is like a bird's nest." He pulled his hand free and his frown deepened. "A greasy bird's nest." He wiped his hand discreetly on the grass.

"What do you expect? Iruka's got me working so hard outside class, how am I supposed to find time to bathe regularly?"

"He's got a point. Baths are for lazy people." Seiko plucked a stick from the ground and used it to pick at a knot in her own hair.

Keta sighed and shook his head, his immaculately combed hair swaying behind him.

Before he could protest any further, a shadow stretched across him from behind. Moto felt a surge of heat pour off Keta's body as his hand shot up and blocked the open hand flying towards his face.

"Damn! I thought I had you." Fumi walked around and threw herself to the ground in front of them. A burst of wind cushioned her as she fell.

Seiko spluttered, wiping at her face as she sat up. "Bleh!" She wiped at her tongue. "You got dirt in my mouth! Honestly, doesn't anybody ever teach you Daggers about manners?"

Fumi looked chastened. "Whoops! Sorry."

Moto sat up as Fumi came into view. He caught himself as his body tensed, forcing his shoulders to relax. He needed to be more social if he wanted to get closer to Soundstealer. "Don't mind her, she just enjoys the opportunity to be snarky."

Fumi hesitated for a moment, weighing the odds before she threw out a joke. "I wondered why anyone was hanging out with you. I guess even prickly people gravitate to their own kind, eh?" Moto had never seen someone so tense after telling a joke. Was she holding her breath?

It turned out to be warranted, since he still prickled in response. Moto forced himself to ignore his petulant reaction and stuck his tongue out instead. Fumi relaxed visibly.

Keta looked back and forth between them. "You are friends now? I was only gone a few weeks!"

"_Provisional_ friends, if she keeps pushing her luck." Moto kept his voice light.

"Even so." Keta turned to Fumi and smiled warmly. "I am glad that you were able to look past the fact that Moto nearly killed you twice." Moto and Fumi both laughed awkwardly. "Ah, too soon for such jokes? Perhaps later."

Seiko cleared her throat.

"Oh, right! Sorry again. My name is Fumi." Fumi held her hand out to Seiko. The glimmer woman shook it, her red eyes stern.

"Seiko. I work in the Gearhouse."

"Nice to meet you Seiko. So what were you all talking about?"

"Keta was just telling us about the mission he got back from yesterday. And how he didn't bother bringing me any exciting souvenirs."

"Oh! How was it?" Fumi's eyes lit up and she leaned forward expectantly. "What kind of mission was it?"

"It was very simple. One of the Woodheart's nature spirits made its home near a village and was attacking the farmers and hunters when they went outside the walls. We were hired to take care of it."

Fumi sucked air through her teeth and groaned. "Oh man. A nature spirit! Ripping holes in the earth, creating whirlwinds. What a cool first mission! I bet the fight looked awesome. Sure would've loved to go on that." She shot Moto a look.

"Yes, it was rather impressive. All the rubble gave me an excellent stage to perform. Though sadly there was no one to watch except the other Daggers. I did learn a few new tricks from the squad leader, though."

Seiko rolled her eyes. "Crazy people."

Fumi wrestled her jealousy into submission and then continued. "Well, speaking of missions, I've got another one if you're ready."

Moto perked up. "You found a good one?"

"Well, I haven't necessarily found one, but I convinced my dad to let us take one of his lower offers. I came over to get you two so we could go take a look."

Keta held up a hand. "What are we talking about?"

Moto's stomach was a mix of excitement and anxiety. This was one step closer, with all that entailed. "Iruka says I'm ready for a mission. Fumi and I figured the three of us could form a squad."

Fumi nodded. "We _are_ the top three new recruits. Teaming up is a good way to get the senior Daggers' attention. And I convinced my dad that the three of us are strong enough to take on one of his contracts."

"Apparently Soundstealer gets a stream of contracts directed especially to him. Fumi had the idea that we could look through the contracts that he wasn't interested in. They're bound to be higher quality than the scraps that normally get handed to new recruits at the Bloodhall."

"This mission would be a greater challenge? I'm in. You two will need a teammate with experience to look after you, anyways. And to make sure you properly bathe."

Moto rolled his eyes, but Fumi took the bait. "You just wait! I've learned some new tricks of my own. If you're not careful, you'll get left behind." The two locked locked eyes and smiled. Competitively.

"Weirdos." Seiko stood and brushed dirt from her legs. "Well, if you three are heading out then I'll get back to work. _Without_ any new toys."

Keta stood and hugged the woman. "I will remember next time."

"Yeah, yeah, yeah." Moto stood and Seiko clasped his wrist in farewell. Her grip was strong and calloused. "By the way, Moto, I was thinking about your training with Iruka and I had an idea for some pretty sweet weapons for the two of you. Stop by and pick them up before you leave."

"Oh. That's awesome, thank you. I'll swing by." Moto watched Seiko walk away, wondering if she was hoping to get something in return. Maybe just an investment, hoping they would bring her interesting materials from their missions.

He turned back to the other two. "Speaking of Iruka, should we grab her before we head over to Zephys and look at contracts?"

Fumi shook her head. "I ran into her on the way here and asked. She said she was busy."

After the records he had seen in the Bloodhall, Moto wasn't surprised. Something had to have happened between Iruka and Soundstealer to break up their squad. Maybe she could be a future ally in Moto's plans.

Moto filed the thought away for another time and the three set out for Soundstealer's home.

<br />

<br />
<br />

They stepped out of the rail cart onto the Zephys spire. After a few months, Moto had accepted his fate riding in the metallic carts that rattled along the spiderwebs of railway connecting the spires of Iga. That didn't mean he enjoyed looking over the edge as the cart careened over clouds and drops into oblivion.

Fumi watched Moto as they walked up the slope to Zephys. "Why do you look so green?"

"The rail carts make him uncomfortable. He is afraid of heights." Keta rubbed Moto's back.

"What! You can control gravity. Why would you be scared of heights?"

"I'm not scared of heights! Not normal heights anyways. But _ridiculous_ heights like riding a little box out into the clouds with a mile drop beneath me... I've been able to control gravity for a few months. I've been _falling_ for 19 years. It takes a while for my brain to catch up."

"I don't see what the big deal is." Fumi turned and continued up the spire with a carefree step. Moto wondered if solid ground would create a similar effect on Fumi as the spires did on him.

The buildings on Zephys spire were more distributed than any of the other Iga houses. They had only hiked a hundred feet up the mountain before Moto started to see isolated huts and platforms cut into the stone, positioned to catch the strong mountain gusts from every side.

Seniority seemed to buy you a higher position on the mountain, with the Daggers looking older as they hiked towards the top. They also got surlier. About halfway up, Moto and Keta started getting looks from anyone they passed.

"Have we done something wrong?" Keta had noticed the looks as well.

"Hm?" Fumi looked over her shoulder as she continued walking up the trail.

"Everyone is staring at us."

Fumi waved a hand. "It's nothing. They're probably just surprised to see non-Zephys Daggers this high up the mountain."

Moto took a step closer to Keta and kept his eyes on the people around them.

Moto heard Soundstealer's home before he saw it. A chaotic mix of jingling chimes and bells, undercut by an incessant whine, emanated from above as they scrambled over the final hurdle of rocks.

Soundstealer's home was, unsurprisingly, at the top of the mountain. It was a narrow, vertical structure that looked like an extension of the spire. The building was three stories, with balconies wrapping around each level.

The entire building was festooned with instruments that clattered in the wind or channeled it into tunnels like horns.

They reached the front door and a guard barred their path. "My lord, who are these people you've brought with you?"

"They're my new squad." Fumi tried to step past the man but he remained in her way.

"Why are they here?"

"Does it matter? They're not a threat. Let us through."

The guard was not dissuaded. "You know the master's feelings about unexpected guests."

Fumi stamped her foot at the man. "I've already talked to my dad. He gave us permission to come here and look at contracts. Now _let us through_. I won't have them saying Soundstealers mistreat their guests."

The guard stared at Fumi for a moment longer before his resolve broke and he stepped aside to let the group through.

As soon as they crossed the threshold, Moto was slapped in the face with silence. The door behind them was still open, but the cacophony of sound made by the wind-blown instruments did not penetrate the building.

"Sorry about that, guys." Fumi turned to face them, her cheeks flushed as she rubbed the back of her head. "Dad's a bit-- What? Why are you both looking around like that?"

Moto rubbed a finger in his ear. "The sound of the chimes outside completely stopped. Is that normal?"

"Yeah, it just means dad's home." Fumi made a face. "It sucks when he's gone on long missions, the inner rooms are the only place you can get any peace." Fumi turned and bounced down a hallway before Moto or Keta could ask more.

Once he got over the initial surprise, Moto surveyed the house. He made an effort to memorize as much of the layout as he could, noting stairways, windows, and guard positions. He noticed with dismay that nearly every floorboard was a nightingale. It was impossible to move without making noise.

The entire building seemed like one giant training space. The walls were covered with weapons, well-worn with use. Floors were littered with sparring dummies or small terrain obstacles. Looking around, Moto didn't feel so bad about his extra training sessions with Iruka. Being at the top didn't allow room for anything else.

They came to a room that was filled with paper. Stacks of it covered several tables, accompanied by ink pots and sealing wax. Sitting amongst the neatly ordered stacks, working through a pile in front of him, was an older man with a bald head, hunched back, and thick spectacles.

"Toru!" Fumi skipped towards the old man like a small child. He looked up at her approach and smiled. "Do you have the contracts ready?"

"Ah yes. I was just putting together what I thought were the best options." Toru's voice quavered in time with his hand as he passed a stack of papers across the table.

Fumi snatched the papers greedily and began flipping through them. Her frown deepened as she flipped through the stack. "These are all assassination contracts, Toru."

"Yes mistress, that is your father's specialty."

"It's not mine, though. I asked for no killing."

Toru began to squirm. "Well, yes mistress. But I thought perhaps when you saw these you might reconsider..."

"I don't want to reconsider. Nobody _likes_ assassins! I want cool, inspiring missions. Like all the Heroes in the Tournament."

"But mistress, assassination contracts pay much better. And there are far more of them..." The discussion was taking on the tone of a well-worn trail.

"For now! We need to show people that they can come to the Daggers with more than their dirty work." A _very_ well-worn trail.

Moto felt a hand rest against his shoulder as a deep voice unfolded behind him like silk. "In this case, daughter, your eccentricities may dovetail nicely with my goals."

Moto felt blood slam through his veins as his body cranked into high alert. He spun, crouching and reaching for a dagger at his belt before he even processed what was going on. He hadn't heard even the hint of a sound behind him. How had someone gotten this close?

Behind him was a tall man rippling with muscle. His long black hair was held in a knot on top of his head. He did not wear the usual Dagger uniform, instead opting for a sleeveless vest and loose pants. His hands and forearms were wrapped in cloth and covered in small bells.

As Moto reached for his dagger reflexively, Soundstealer spared him a sideways glance that dismissed the threat completely. Moto forced his hand to freeze.

Keta's reaction was less restrained.

There was a wave of steam as the shapeling pulled heat into his body and twisted, aiming a roundhouse kick at Soundstealer's head. Even at Keta's full speed, Soundstealer leaned back casually, dodging the blow as he brought his palm up and hit Keta with a tight pulse of wind. Keta took the blow on the chest and backflipped to absorb the momentum.

The entire exchange was completely silent. Not quiet. Devoid of sound.

Keta straightened and relaxed his body. "You caught me off guard."

"Yes, that was the point. Your lack of hesitation is admirable, but you should have aimed for my knees. Not as flashy, but harder to dodge." Soundstealer's face and voice remained impassive as he spoke.

"Dad! Why can't you just welcome guests like a normal human being?"

"Why have you brought these two here?"

"They came to look at contracts, like we talked about, remember?"

Moto struggled to follow the conversation with his pulse beating in his ears. His hand still remained on his dagger. This was the man who had killed his family. His entire village. Standing no more than two feet away. He could strike now. Or could he? Soundstealer had swatted Keta away like an annoying fly.

"I did not think you would bring them directly into our home. I have told you to keep inter house fraternization to a minimum outside of what is needed on missions. You do not wish to weaken your resonance, do you?"

"No, but--."

"Then do not bring these distractions here again."

Soundstealer wasn't doing anything threatening. He didn't even sound hostile. But something about his presence put Moto on edge. Even without his obvious reasons to hate Soundstealer, Moto felt like he would have been uncomfortable around the man. Keta seemed similarly unsettled.

Soundstealer pulled a small, rolled up parchment from his belt and tossed it to Fumi. "This is your mission. I believe it should satisfy your requirements. It's a rescue mission. Very 'heroic'. And no killing. It's useless to me, save that the requester is a very important client."

Fumi unrolled the contract and summarized it for Keta and Moto. "A wealthy merchant was bringing his family from Matsuri to his new home in Jidoka when the convoy was attacked by monsters. They took the merchant's youngest son prisoner. We find their lair and get the kid back." Fumi rolled up the contract and nodded to her father.

"Good. Now escort these two out of the building and come upstairs for training." Soundstealer turned and walked from the room.

Fumi escorted them outside, offering her apologies. "He'll warm up after we do a couple missions. He's just a bit standoffish at first." She shut the door and left them standing outside amidst the din of wind chimes surrounding the house.

"Well, I guess she takes more after her mom. Something about that guy gave me the creeps."

Keta nodded. "He is like a ghost, moving through the world but not existing in it."

"Yeah, do you think Fumi can kill sound the same way?"

"It was not just sound. When my foot passed by him, it did not even stir up a small breeze. The air felt completely dead around him."

<br />

<br />
<br />

The new squad sat in a clearing as the sun went down. Keta and Fumi were relaxing around the fire as Iruka continued teaching Moto how to use the stone cloud.

It was a strange feeling, being back in the wilderness and not being afraid for his life. Before he'd made his way to Koga and joined the Daggers, Moto had spent a harrowing year wandering north through the overgrown pine forests, running and hiding from every sound that came from the mists.

"Good, now try to shift the orbit. Bring the stone over your shoulder."

Moto tuned out Keta and Fumi's chatter and focused on the stone circling around his waist. He pulled against the rock, alternating from his shoulder and his knee. He smiled as it slid into the new trajectory.

It had taken a while to master the constant modulation of gravitational strength and direction to hold an orbit. But the hardest part had been learning to exert that level of finesse from anywhere on his body, not just his hands and feet.

Maintaining even one stone's orbit absorbed Moto's attention completely. Just listening to Iruka's instructions caused the trajectory to waver.

Iruka raised her arm with the palm facing Moto. "Now stretch the orbit out, bring it to my hand." Keta and Fumi clapped politely as the stone's orbit shifted to a long ellipse that passed just a few inches in front of Iruka's hand.

Moto pulled the stone back to his hand and turned to Fumi and Keta in a huff. "Hey, it's not as easy as it looks! And not all of us have had a _lifetime_ of training."

Keta and Fumi exchanged a look. "We did not mean to make fun of you."

"Yeah! I'm impressed with how much progress you've made in just a week. I spent my whole life around stone-bringers and I've never seen anyone fighting this way."

Moto had to train in front of Keta and Fumi while they traveled for the mission. It was necessary if he wanted to keep improving, but he didn't like it. Their praise felt like constant patronizing. Like a parent proud of their child's first steps.

Moto forced a smile and tried to play his frustration off as sheepishness. "Really?"

"Yeah, kid. You're learning faster than I did." Iruka's arms were crossed, the corner of her mouth twitched up in a smirk. "But then again, I was also _inventing_ the technique while I learned. So don't let it go to your head too much."

Moto turned back to Iruka and tossed the rock towards her. She pulled it into orbit with ease. "Well, if you're so great, why don't you try to hit me?" Moto shot a smirk back at her.

Iruka put the back of her hand to her forehead dramatically. "Such disrespect for your wise, honorable sensei." The stone shot around towards Moto.

Moto was ready. He pulled a rock from behind and intercepted Iruka's shot in midair.

"Nice." Iruka held her hands out and the two falling stones moved towards her. Moto did the same. There was a brief moment of struggle and Iruka looked surprised that Moto was able to put up some resistance. Then she ripped the stones away. "Can you block two though?" Her smirk returned.

Iruka's stones did a loop and shot towards him. She knew he couldn't control two stones with the precision necessary to intercept both missiles. But he didn't have to. Moto reached into the pouch at his back, pulled out one of the metal spheres Seiko gave him, and threw it.

Moto waited until the sphere was right in front of the two stones, then he pulled on the lever at its center. The ball flattened, flaring into a shield in mid-air.

The two stones clattered into the new barrier and fell to the ground. Moto pulled the shield back and caught it as internal springs snapped it back into a sphere. Iruka looked dumbfounded.

"Beautiful!" Keta clapped with glee.

"Alright kid, I'll give you this one. I'm surprised. What was that?"

Moto felt a flush of pride. "One of the glimmers at the gearhouse made it for me. I have different types."

Iruka walked over. "Can I see it?"

"I was hoping you could help me figure out the best ways to use them." Moto held the sphere out to her. "If you pull on this lever it releases the metal plates that make up the sphere. And the lever is attached to the front, so pulling on it stops that plate and makes the sphere collapse."

Fumi and Keta approached to look as well, but both lost interest when they learned the weapons only worked for stone-bringers. They walked further into the woods to spar.

"I've never seen anything like this." Iruka started whipping the sphere back and forth, smiling each time the sphere flared with a satisfying _kachink_.

Moto pulled out a handful of other spheres. "Seiko wired up a few different effects to the lever." He tossed one in the air and pulled. Blades protruded from the sides as the sphere flattened. Another split into three parts connected by rope like a bolo.

"What about those?" Iruka pointed to a few that Moto hadn't thrown.

"Seiko said these were single-use. There's a smoke bomb, an explosive, and spring-loaded darts."

Iruka whistled. "Sounds like I need to make myself a friend in the Gearhouse."

Moto hesitated for a moment, looking at the weapons jealously. "You can have some if you want."

Iruka took the blade sphere and pulled it from both sides. It hung in the air between her hands, flat with blades out. She frowned for a second and the disc began to spin. Slowly at first, but faster as Iruka got the hang of it. Soon it was whirring like a saw.

Iruka spun her arms and whipped the spinning blade through a tree nearby tree trunk. It snapped back into a sphere as she caught it. "Really? These are are something special."

Moto shrugged. "Seiko said she'll make me more if I bring her back exciting things."

"Maybe I'll borrow this one then. Thanks, kid."

"Well, it's not totally free. How about I get one question in exchange?"

Iruka looked over her glasses at Moto. "Depends on the question..."

Maybe this was being too direct. He had no idea if Soundstealer was a touchy subject for Iruka. Or was their partnership even common knowledge? This might give him away.

Moto let out a sigh. He needed allies. "I heard you used to be on a squad with Soundstealer..."

Iruka blinked. "Yeah, what about it?"

"I was just wondering what happened? He seems like a pretty prestigious partner, and you're really strong. So how did you end up teaching the new recruits?"

"I didn't 'end up' teaching the new recruits. I chose to do it. Turns out it's a lot more interesting than dealing with the politics."

Moto pressed harder once he saw Iruka didn't immediately freak out. "Please, I spent less than two minutes near Soundstealer and even I know 'not interesting' isn't one of his flaws. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to."

"Oh yeah? And you'll just let me keep this fancy new toy?"

"I didn't say _that_."

Iruka laughed and pushed his shoulder. "You're too big for your britches kid. You do know I'm your sensei, right?"

"What, am I supposed to be running some kind of charity over here?"

"Alright, fine. But only because this thing is so cool."

Moto sat down by the fire expectantly and waited for Iruka to join him.

"I joined Soundstealer's squad, what, eight years ago? Yeah I think that's right. Wow, it's been a while." She stared into the fire for a moment before she continued. "He was older than me by a few years, and definitely up and coming.

"Back then I was really ambitious. I thought I had my ticket made when I got onto his squad. For a while, it seemed like it. Soundstealer had a partner. A water-eater from his year named Sugi who was also a big deal. And as you are obviously aware, I was awesome too. The three of us were unstoppable.

"It was really fun, too. WE threw everything into our missions, and competing with each other. They were my best friends."

Moto's stomach dropped. That didn't bode well for alliances. "Were?"

Iruka shook her head. "Yeah, were. One day Soundstealer got offered a big contract. From Hisoka directly. Taking it basically guaranteed he'd become head of Zephys. But we already had a contract, and Daggers never drop a contract.

"Hisoka absolved Soundstealer, but Sugi and I were still on the hook. We probably could have begged off, saying the contract was too big without Soundstealer. But Sugi didn't want to look weak. He thought everyone would say Soundstealer was the only reason we were strong.

"So we took the mission anyways, with a weaker replacement. I was the only one who survived."

Iruka was staring absently into the fire. Moto placed an uncertain hand on her shoulder. "Don't tell Fumi, but Keta and I thought Soundstealer was a creep."

Iruka snorted and wiped at the corner of her eye. "The worst part was Soundstealer didn't even come to the funeral. I tried to tell myself he felt too guilty, but honestly I think he was just too busy looking up the mountain. After that, all the political games just seemed pointless.

"So does that satisfy your curiosity, oh nosy pupil?"

Moto nodded. "I'd say it was a fair trade. I never knew him, but I'm sorry about Sugi."

Iruka stood, tossing the blade sphere up and down. "He was a good guy, but he had nothing to blame but his own ego at the end. Thanks again for the new toy. You said a glimmer named Seiko made it?"

"Yeah, why?"

"Just wanted to know who to seek out when we get back to Iga. Maybe she's in the market for a cooler, more attractive friend than you." Iruka winked and walked over to her tent.

<br />

<br />
<br />

They crouched atop a rocky hill, overgrown with moss and pine trees. Below them, a dark rent in the rock marked the entrance to a cave. Thick webs coated the rock face and covered part of the entrance. Things seemed abandoned for now, but they stayed far from the edge to be safe.

The trail had been relatively easy to follow this far. Most monsters weren't known for their subtlety. The ones that were had much higher ranked contracts.

Fumi spoke in a whisper. "Judging by the webs and the weirdness of the tracks, I'm going to guess spiders. Big spiders."

Iruka nodded. "Probably jorogumo. One of the Woodheart's monsters."

Keta smiled. "Ah another one! My last dance was with one of the Woodheart's spawn. Do you think I will gain a reputation?"

Moto rolled his eyes. "Have you fought any jorogumo before, Iruka?"

"None personally, but I know a bit about them. Giant spiders with a venom that drives you mad, makes you attack anything around you. Their vision is pretty limited since they mostly sense through vibrations in their webs. They like to hunt by setting traps, biting a few people in a group, then letting them take care of each other."

"Right, so don't get bitten. How big are we talking when you say 'giant'?"

"The size of a dog, I'd say."

"Nice!" Fumi was bouncing with excitement. "You know, people say Sakuya's never been the same since she fought the Four Seasons, but you have to admit she knows how to make a good monster. Giant spiders? Classic."

Keta nodded. "My last fight was quite the spectacle as well. Sakuya has the heart of a dancer. I can tell."

Moto looked between them. "Seiko was right. The two of you are _weird_."

Fumi soldiered on. "So what's the plan? Take the place by force? I can drop down and blast away the webbing with a wind blast. That should open up a shot for the two of you to chuck some stones and crack some skulls."

Moto shook his head. "Our mission is to get the boy home alive, assuming the monsters haven't killed him already. It _has_ been a couple weeks."

"The kid will be alive. If they took him hostage at all then that means he's bait. They won't kill him until they're sure no one is coming to the rescue. It's how the gods programmed them."

"Right, so he's only bait until they know we've bitten. They might just kill him once they know he's served his purpose. Even if not, I don't want to fight through a heard of spiders while also worrying about a hostage."

"So... stealth mission?" Fumi thought for a moment. "I guess that's pretty cool too. So long as we tell people about it afterwards, of course."

Moto looked at Iruka. "What do you think?"

She shrugged. "Not my decision, kid. I'm just here to make sure things don't go off the rails."

"Alright, stealth mission then, like Fumi said." Fumi beamed at the credit. Easy enough to predict. She wasn't going to like the next part, though. "But I don't think we should all go in. If there's a trap, we don't want everyone springing it together. Fumi and Iruka, I think you two should wait outside."

"What!" Fumi pushed the bounds of what could be called a whisper. "No way am I playing _back up_."

"Not back up. Look, there's two ways I see this ending. Either we spring a trap or we find the kid. Either way, we're not going to make it out as quietly as we made it in. Whoever goes in first is going to find the kid and then try to make it as far back as they can before the jorogumo find them and pin them down.

"At that point, the outside folks need to come blasting in as fast as possible to get us out. The strongest people should stay outside." Play to her ego. "And like you said earlier, your wind blasts are probably the fastest way to blow past the webs."

Fumi looked thoughtful. "So Iruka and I get to go all out?" Moto nodded. "And we rescue everybody at the last minute. Just like the stories." She was speaking quietly to herself at this point. It took a significant effort for Moto not to shake his head. "Alright, you can count on me."

"Keta, are you in?"

The shapeling had been sitting cross-legged, eyes closed while they planned. He opened his eyes. "We are done talking now?" He stood and stretched. "Yes, let's begin."

"Great, let's circle back and find an approach that--."

Keta jumped off the cliff and landed beside the cave. Moto stared after, dumbstruck. Iruka failed to stifle a chuckle behind him.

"I don't know why I expected anything different." Moto sighed and jumped after Keta.

<br />

<br />
<br />

The cave entrance led to a narrow tunnel with rough-hewn walls and a floor worn smooth by a not quite dried-up river. The damp, mossy floor made walking on the downward slope treacherous.

On top of the dangerous footing, thin filaments of thread stretched randomly across the hallway. Trip wires to alert the spiders of any clumsy guests.

They reached a bend in the tunnel and the way ahead was completely dark. Moto put a hand on Keta's shoulder to stop him. "I guess there aren't any other exits nearby." He lit the small travel lantern and left if hooded so the light spilled no further than a few feet ahead.

As they crept forward, the incline steepened until they had to hold onto the wall to stop from slipping. Moto had a brief vision of Fumi trying to inch forward carefully, painstakingly. Scanning every step for trip wires, making sure every footing was secure. They would have been found in seconds.

Keta didn't move with the same caution as Moto, but his ridiculous balance and dexterity seemed to made up for it.

An alien chittering made them pull up short. It was accompanied by a series of clicks and scraping as too many legs moved across stone. The sounds were uncomfortably close, echoing off the hard walls so they came from all directions. Or maybe there were spiders everywhere. Their five foot bubble of light felt very claustrophobic.

The skittering sounds faded and they began easing their way forward again. A few seconds later there was a sharp, wet sound like a butcher's blade cutting through meat. It was followed by a series of flatter slurping sounds. The pattern repeated itself. _Sssk_. _Schlup, schlup, schlup_. A steady patter began that could only be blood dripping to the floor.

Keta's foot shifted sharply as a patch of moss tore free under his weight. He hopped forward, trying to recover. Except that forward was empty air, the downward slope falling away into what was once a waterfall. Keta's hand snapped to the wall, trying to catch his weight.

The stone broke free and Keta continued over the edge.

Moto took two steps forward and fell. He anchored his feet to the stone wall for balance, then pulled with all his strength against the cave ceiling and the falling shapeling. A few rocks pulled free of the ceiling under the combined weight of two people.

Keta's body came to a halt and he spun without hesitation, snatching the falling rocks from the air before they fell into the webbing that stretched below them.

Sitting on the webs at the edge of the lantern was a monstrosity. Moto didn't know what kind of dogs Iruka had when she was growing up, but the hairy black spider in front of them came up to their waist easily. The creature's back was to them as it dissected a bloody carcass wrapped in web.

Moto held his breath, waiting to see if the spider would turn towards the light. When it continued eating undisturbed, he slowly pulled Keta into his arms and both of them back onto the ledge.

Moto pointed to the two stones in Keta's hands. "Nice catch."

"You as well." He smiled easily.

"That thing didn't react to the light, and considering that this cave is filled with surprise cliffs, I say we risk a bit more light. What do you think?"

Keta nodded and they raised the hood on the lantern by a fraction. Enough to spread dim light across the cavern in front of them. They stood at the top of a lopsided pit, carved from the stone by whatever river was now on its dying breaths.

Below them, the pit dropped into blackness, strung across with so many webs they wouldn't have been able to see the bottom anyways. The criss-crossing silk was dotted with angry welts of red. Some old, some fresh. An alarming number human sized. Large shadowy masses moved amongst them.

On the far side of the wall, 20 feet away, there was a small opening where the cave continued.

Moto pointed. "Can you jump that?"

"Yes, but not quietly."

"OK, hold on and I'll give you a boost. Jump as hard as you can without making a sound." Moto eased himself out onto the rock wall. He pulled against the stone and walked to the center of the ceiling, hanging like a bat. A small cloud of stones hung a few feet below him where he had caught the debris dislodged by his passage. He pulled the rocks into his hand and tucked them into a pocket.

Moto gave Keta a thumbs up and the shapeling crouched. Moto's torch flickered as steam began to rise off of Keta's body. He leapt forward.

Moto pulled on Keta's shoulders. Not enough to hold his entire weight. Moto didn't want to test the strength of the ceiling again. But enough so that Keta floated through the air with a disorienting mix of floatiness and forward speed. He touched down in the far opening without a sound.

Moto padded along the ceiling and joined him. When he stepped back onto normal ground, Keta gave him a hug, his cheeks flushed. "That was wonderful! I am enjoying our first dance together. You are an excellent partner." Moto blushed.

The tunnel on the other side was dry and more gently sloped, allowing them to move more confidently. They continued at the faster pace until they came to a split in the tunnel.

Moto dropped to the ground and looked at the floor. Both paths were solid stone, so there wasn't much in the way of tracks, but he looked for other differences. The trail to the right was littered with loose pebbles and gravel, while the left path was more clear.

"I can't tell for sure, but I'm going to guess the left tunnel."

Keta shrugged and started to walk in that direction.

Moto blinked. "Wait! Don't you want to know why?"

"I trust your judgment. If it was important to know why you would have told me."

"Well, sure, but I think it was a pretty smart observation. There's no loose stones to the left. Like someone was dragged--." Keta was already at the edge of the lamplight. Moto sighed and followed.

As they moved further down the left tunnel, it widened into an oblong cavern with clusters of webbing covering alcoves and partially blocking the path. They heard skittering ahead and dulled the lantern.

As the lamplight dimmed, Moto realized something else was illuminating the cavern. A large, pale white light source was shifting erratically across the floor. It took Moto's brain a second to shift perspective and realize what the source of the light was.

Moto could see two more of the giant black spiders they had seen earlier. But moving across the cavern floor between them was a spider that made them look like toys. It stood well over head height, with long delicate legs and dull grey skin that was mottled with chaotic patches of shining white.

The light spider was moving between several large clumps of silk, running its forelegs across the bundles for some reason Moto couldn't discern. One of the bundles shifted weakly as the creature approached.

Moto grabbed Keta and pulled him away from the cavern. "That is _not_ the kind of spider Iruka was talking about."

"Certainly not. What should we do?"

"None of those web bundles was little boy sized. My guess is that it was more of the convoy that got ambushed. I say we leave this place and check out the other hallway. The kid's gotta be down that way."

"Some of the people in there were still moving."

"Yeah, but we're not on a mission to save them. We can't risk alerting the rest of the nest that we're here. They may kill the boy."

"The same may happen to these people if we alert the nest when we rescue the child. I won't leave them here to die." Keta planted his feet.

What should he do? If they failed to save the boy, Soundstealer might never let them take on more of his missions. And he said this client was important. What if it was the same person who hired Soundstealer to attack Moto's village? Success here might be a big step to finding out.

"Keta, we're already doing a lot of good here. We're going to save this little kid. If we try to save everyone, we might end up saving no one. Our chances are better if we stay focused."

"I understand what you are saying, but I will not do math with people's lives."

Moto tried to think of a convincing argument. Keta's face was set, his arms crossed defiantly. He was so confident in his abilities. Determined to help everyone he could.

Did he really want to convince Keta? What would it do to him to leave people behind in the name of caution?

Moto shook his head, angry at both sides of the argument. "Alright, fine. We'll give it a shot."

Moto drew his dagger and placed the blade against one of the web tripwires. Keta held the silk on either side, heat radiating off his body to increase his physical control. Moto cut the thread, holding his breath. Nothing happened.

He released the held breath while Keta carefully, painstakingly, lowered the bisected ends to the ground and rooted them to the floor. They repeated the process with the other two alarms stretching out of the cavern.

At least now if things got crazy, they might be able to contain the problem to this room.

They stalked back to the cavern entrance. Keta dropped into a crouch, his arms thrown back. "Like this?"

"Yeah, perfect." Moto leaned his chest against Keta's back, extending his arms over the shapeling's shoulders. Keta slid his feet forward to brace. "Ready?"

A faint hiss of steam and Keta's body was uncomfortably hot.

"Don't forget to stay low." Moto grabbed both spiders with his power and pulled as hard as he could, throwing his arms backward like he held them on a rope. As he guessed, neither spider was particularly heavy. But pulling both at once caused him to slam forward into Keta. The shapeling held him easily.

The spiders flicked into the air, careening towards Moto. Once he saw they were in the air, Moto let them fly on their own. Keta show forward as soon as the pressure on his back eased.

Moto pulled with his hand against the loose rock that he had laid on floor behind them, tracing a wide arc over his head. The stones zipped past in a blur.

Keta reached the first flying spider. He planted his front foot and through a haymaker towards the creature. With the combined momentum of Keta's punch and Moto's pull, the spider nearly evaporated on impact.

Keta let the momentum from his punch carry him forward, pushing off with his front leg into a front flip that ended with his heel in the second spider's face. Another cloud of spider goo.

The light spider's head shot up just as Moto's shrapnel cloud cut through it's face and abdomen. It's body twitched on impact, then fell limply to the ground.

The whole thing was done in an instant.

Moto took a deep breath and stood straight. He walked toward Keta, who was already wiping spider guts from his hand. The shapeling turned and smiled. "You see? You worry for nothing."

"Yeah, yeah. You were right."

Keta's eyes shifted above Moto's head and his smile disappeared. His legs tensed and he shot forward.

Moto didn't hesitate, he pulled against the wall, trying to pull himself away from the ambush. Idiot! He'd been so focused on the creatures in front he hadn't thought there might be more above the entrance.

Pain lanced through his shoulder as the spider's fangs sunk deep. There was a hot pulse in his face as the venom entered his veins. Then the spider's weight disappeared as Keta's knee collided with it's midsection, crushing it to a pulp.

Moto stumbled away, his vision blurry. His balance felt off.

"Are you OK?"

Moto turned and cried out in alarm. Keta's form was ripping apart. Large, black spider legs emerged from his back as his mouth filled with fangs. Eyes began to sprout all over his face. Moto took a step back as the creature hissed at him.

He shook his head. This was just the venom. Iruka said it messed with your head.

The creature lunged at him. Moto couldn't help himself. He fell back, pulling on a rock behind him and launching it at the creature. There was a spray of blood from its thigh as the shot hit its mark. The arachnid form kept coming.

Moto tried to scrambled backwards. He drew his dagger and lashed out. Another spray of blood as the humanoid spider blocked the blow with its arm. It grabbed Moto in impossibly strong arms, lifting him into the air as it brought it's fangs toward his face.

As the creature's fangs caught him, a flush of warmth spread across his face. Moto's vision cleared and his rational brain clicked back into place. Moto was pinned against Keta, held in place as the shapeling kissed him. He could feel the muscles in Keta's arms a chest tense as they held against Moto's flailing.

Moto melted into the embrace as his heart rate slowed. The tension in Keta's arms eased as Moto's body relaxed, allowing Moto to bring his arms around Keta's waist. Heat was pouring from the shapeling's lips.

After a moment they separated, red faced and breathing fast.

"How did you do that?"

Keta smiled. "You are not the only one who has been practicing. The master who led my last mission was also a fire-eater. He taught me how to transfer heat to others through touch."

"You sped up my metabolism to burn off the poison."

Keta nodded. Then he winced at the wounds along is arm and leg. "You have gotten much faster."

"Ah, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?"

Keta took a deep breath and the bleeding stopped. "I am fine, though I'll need to rest before I have enough energy to heal completely." He pulled a bandage from his pouch and wound it around his leg.

"Why didn't you just grab my hand or something?"

A mischievous smile spread across his face. "A kiss was much more dramatic, no?"

Moto rolled his eyes. "You're such an idiot. Come on, let's get these people free so we can carry on with the actual mission."

Keta walked up to the human-shaped bundles of silk and began cutting them free. He eased the people to the ground, reassuring them as they came to.

While Keta worked, Moto went to take a look at the light spider. It was even more grotesque up close. It bore a vague resemblance to the smaller black spiders, but its skin was stretched and torn like it had outgrown itself. The patterns of light were exposed, glowing innards where the skin had ripped open. The skin was light gray from the light shining through underneath.

The light spider twitched and lunged feebly towards Moto. "Ah!"

Keta turned. "Are you OK?"

"Yeah, looks like this thing just had a little bit of juice left." Moto pulled a dagger from his belt and stabbed the creature between the eyes. It fell back to the ground and the light in it's body went out.

Back in the hallway from where they had come, echoing up from deep within the nest, a child began to scream.
