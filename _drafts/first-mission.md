"Let me get this straight. A _mountain_ tried to kill you? And the only thing it managed for the trouble was that little scrape on your arm?" Seiko cocked her head sideways, tangled, red hair dangling past her shoulder as she looked at the bandage on Keta's bicep. Her face expressed about as much belief as the arms crossed in front of her.

Keta sat on the ground, legs outstretched and leaning back on his long arms. He shrugged, somehow the move looked graceful. "It was not a particularly fast mountain."

Moto laid on his back, his head in Keta's lap. "Don't forget the wind and the trees. They tried to kill you too." He was only half listening to the conversation. The rest of his attention was admiring the way the Shapeling's face caught the afternoon sunlight. He was glad Keta was back.

Keta smiled as though remembering a fond childhood memory. "The wind was much faster."

Seiko threw up her hands. "I'll never understand you weirdos. That sounds like a _bad_ day. But look at him. Smiling like he won a toy at the fair."

"You're just mad he didn't bring you back some part of the monster to tinker with."

Seiko uncrossed her arms and flopped onto her back like a stocky, red-haired starfish. "Is it so much to ask? The Gearhouse doesn't trust me with _any_ fun toys."

Keta's eyes scrunched closed as he laughed. "It has been how many walls that you've blown out since we met? Three?"

"Only two! The third one was before Moto and I met." She was a sulking starfish now.

Keta ran a hand through Moto's hair. He frowned and looked down at Moto. "What is this? Your hair is like a bird's nest." He pulled his hand free and his frown deepened. "A greasy bird's nest." He wiped his hand discreetly on the grass.

"What do you expect? Iruka's got me working so hard outside class, how am I supposed to find time to bathe regularly?"

"He's got a point. Baths are for lazy people." Seiko plucked a stick from the ground and used it to pluck at a knot in her own hair.

Keta sighed and shook his head, his immaculately combed hair swaying behind him.

Before he could protest any further, a shadow stretched across him from behind. Moto felt a surge of heat pour off Keta's body as his hand shot up and blocked the open hand flying towards his face.

"Damn! I thought I had you." Fumi walked around and threw herself to the ground in front of them. A burst of wind cushioned her as she fell.

Seiko spluttered, wiping at her face as she sat up. "Bleh!" She wiped at her tongue. "You got dirt in my mouth! Honestly, doesn't anybody ever teach you Daggers about manners?"

Fumi looked chastened. "Whoops! Sorry."

Moto sat up as Fumi came into view. He caught himself as his body tensed, forcing his shoulders to relax. He needed to be more social if he wanted to get closer to Soundstealer. "Don't mind her, she just enjoys the opportunity to be snarky."

Fumi hesitated for a moment, weighing the odds before she threw out a joke. "I wondered why anyone was hanging out with you. I guess even prickly people gravitate to their own kind, eh?" Moto had never seen someone so tense after telling a joke. Was she holding her breath?

It turned out to be warranted, since he still prickled in response. Moto forced himself to ignore his petulant reaction and stuck his tongue out instead. Fumi relaxed visibly.

Keta looked back and forth between them. "You are friends now? I was only gone a few weeks!"

"_Provisional_ friends, if she keeps pushing her luck." Moto kept his voice light.

"Even so." Keta turned to Fumi and smiled warmly. "I am glad that you were able to look past the fact that Moto nearly killed you twice." Moto and Fumi both laughed awkwardly. "Ah, too soon for such jokes? Perhaps later."

Seiko cleared her throat.

"Oh, right! Sorry again. My name is Fumi." Fumi held her hand out to Seiko. The glimmer woman shook it, her red eyes stern.

"Seiko. I work in the Gearhouse."

"Nice to meet you Seiko. So what were you all talking about?"

"Keta was just telling us about the mission he got back from yesterday. And how he didn't bother bringing me any exciting souvenirs."

"Oh! How was it?" Fumi's eyes lit up and she leaned forward expectantly. "What kind of mission was it?"

"It was very simple. One of the Woodheart's nature spirits made its home near a village and was attacking the farmers and hunters when they went outside the walls. We were hired to take care of it."

Fumi sucked air through her teeth and groaned. "Oh man. A nature spirit! Ripping holes in the earth, creating whirlwinds. What a cool first mission! I bet the fight looked awesome. Sure would've loved to go on that." She shot Moto a look.

"Yes, it was rather impressive. All the rubble gave me an excellent stage to perform. Though sadly there was no one to watch except the other Daggers. I did learn a few new tricks from the squad leader, though."

Seiko rolled her eyes. "Crazy people."

Fumi wrestled her jealousy into submission and then continued. "Well, speaking of missions, I've got another one if you're ready."

Moto perked up. "You found a good one?"

"Well, I haven't necessarily found one, but I convinced my dad to let us take one of his lower offers. I came over to get you two so we could go take a look."

Keta held up a hand. "What are we talking about?"

Moto's stomach was a mix of excitement and anxiety. This was one step closer, with all that entailed. "Iruka says I'm ready for a mission. Fumi and I figured the three of us could form a squad."

Fumi nodded. "We _are_ the top three new recruits. Teaming up is a good way to get the senior Daggers' attention. And I convinced my dad that the three of us are strong enough to take on one of his contracts."

"Apparently Soundstealer gets his own stream of contracts requesting his specific involvement. Fumi had the idea that we could look through the contracts that he wasn't interested in. They're bound to be higher quality than the scraps that normally get handed to new recruits at the Bloodhall."
