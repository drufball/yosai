Mamoru paused in front of the door. He took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders a few times, steeling himself for the confrontation ahead. He pulled a cloth binding from the satchel at his side and draped it across one arm. He pressed his coarse hair flat with his free hand.

He knocked, wincing as his knuckles wrapped against the wood.

There was a crash as something smashed against the other side of the door. "You will not touch me again, Hideyo!"

Mamoru pushed the door open slightly and waved his hand through the crack. "Kats! It's me, not Hideyo." Mamoru made sure the bandage remained behind the door.

There was a moment of silence. "Come in."

Mamoru slid through the doorway, closing it carefully. The room he stepped into was small and windowless. The ceiling was tall enough for Mamoru to stand at his full six and a half feet, but short enough that he slouched reflexively. A small fire pit smoldered in the corner, coating the wall in soot. 

Functional was the only word that could be applied to the buildings in Hokko.

The rest of the room was dominated by layers of animal furs arranged into a bed. Katsumi sat amongst them, her back propped against the wall. When she saw the bandage in Mamoru's other hand, her eyes narrowed.

"She sent you, didn't she."

"Kats, we've been over this. Hideyo is just trying to help."

"A hawk does not seek help from a _mouse_."

Mamoru sighed as he knelt down beside Katsumi. "How are you feeling?"

"I feel fine. It's been three months. I am ready to leave."

"Hideyo says you need another week or two. Her magic stitched you up, but your body isn't done strengthening the threads. Can I take a look?"

Katsumi nodded and pulled her rough-spun shirt over her head. She wore nothing underneath. Mamoru took a moment to admire her thickly muscled arms, her powerful shoulders. His eyes lingered on her breasts. Katsumi watched him as he looked at her.

He blushed and shifted his gaze to the bandages wrapped around the shapeshifter's midsection. "I, uh... I need to look at the... can I remove the..." He shifted his hands awkwardly, reaching towards the bandages and quickly pulling them away.

Katsumi snorted. "Like a frightened dear every time." She raised her arms over her head.

Mamoru set the new bandage on the furs next to him, careful not to contaminate the thick poultice smeared across it. He moved closer to Katsumi. With delicate fingers he untied the knot on the old binding. His arms wrapped around her waist as he unwound the bandage. Her hands rested on his shoulders as he worked, their faces inches apart. Their breathing quickened.

Mamoru finished removing the bandage. A fist-sized, angry red scar obscured Katsumi's otherwise well-defined abs. Mamoru's fingers rested against scar, still looking into Katsumi's eyes. His hand moved upwards hesitantly, trailing along Katsumi's skin. She pulled him towards her.

Katsumi kissed like she fought. She used her strength to move Mamoru where she wanted, pulling his body onto hers. Mamoru tensed in surprise as she bit his lip. But he quickly adjusted, letting the energy overtake him as well. Mamoru grabbed one of Katsumi's hands resting at the back of his neck and pushed it against the wall behind her. Lost in the moment, his hand moved faster than he expected, slamming her hand into the wall harder than he intended. She winced briefly.

Mamoru pulled back like a man avoiding a blow. "Ah, sorry! I'm still getting used to--."

Katsumi reached out and grabbed him, pulling him back towards her. "Don't insult me with your concern."

But Mamoru pressed a hand against the wall, holding himself back. "No, this is a bad idea. I'm still not used to the strength Tsukuyomi left inside me. I could hurt you." Mamoru pulled himself a way with visible reluctance.

Katsumi growled and brought her hands down in frustration. "I am not as _fragile_ as you think I am."

"I know you're not fragile, Kats. But you _are_ injured. Accepting one doesn't require the other." Mamoru clasped his hands behind his head. "I already did _this_ to you. I'd rather not make it worse." 

There was a long silence as the two regained their composure.

"You want to wait until I am fully recovered. But when that time comes, I will leave."

Mamoru's face fell. "You still want to leave? But the rebellion needs you."

"The rebellion is dead, Mamoru. It died when your friend shot Yoshinobu in the heart." Katsumi looked towards the coals of the fire. "It's time I found my own battles again."

"The rebellion isn't dead. We still have the three of us. And Seiji once he wakes up. We have the army here. Hideyo says more should be coming up from the south soon." Mamoru paused for a moment. "And Chiyoko. I don't know what her plan is, but she has one. That's how she always was, growing up. Three steps ahead of me."

"You are a fool. Chiyoko struck because she was strong and Yoshinobu was weak. That's how the world works."

"That's not how _she_ works."

"Regardless. I did not join the rebellion because these people _needed_ me. I joined to fight. Without Yoshinobu, the army thinks only of defense."

"It won't always be that way, though." Mamoru picked up the new bandage and began to wind it around Katsumi. She did not move to stop him, but neither did she look back from the fire.

"It's been three months and all Hideyo has done is strengthen the walls and build defenses. There is no fire in the soldier's eyes. Only fear and sadness. If I stay here I may as well be a beast in a cage."

"What about us?" Mamoru caught himself and quickly added. "If you leave you'll never get your chance for a rematch, I mean."

"I have said that you may join me."

"You know I can't leave the people here."

"And you know I cannot stay."

Mamoru finished wrapping Katsumi's bandage in silence, unsure what to say. Eventually he finished and the two sat next to each other, their shoulders touching. The mood fell into to a comfortable silence.

After a few minutes, the pair was broken from their reverie by a knock at the door. "Mamoru, sir. Hideyo has asked that you meet her on the walls." One of the soldiers from the rebellion. No one from Hokko would ever call Mamoru sir.

"Can it wait?"

"I don't think so, sir. The rest of our forces just arrived from the south. Most of them are dead."

<br />

<br />

Mamoru hurried through the village, his breath fogging in the perpetual cold. A soldier had pointed him in the direction of Hideyo and he made his way as directly as he could, picking through the busy village.

Hokko was still littered with piles of rubble from the battle with Tsukuyomi four months ago. But the rebellion soldiers had helped rebuild several of the single-story, thatched roof buildings. A group of men and women were splitting tree trunks that had been piled at the village center, preparing them to use for further repairs. They discussed the newly arrived soldiers in nervous whispers.

Slender pyramids built from wood dotted the perimeter of Hokko, just inside the inner wall. Each tower had a series of interlocking gears working from the base of the structure up to a large metal sphere covered in holes. Periodically, a small gout of flame would erupt from one of the openings. Mamoru still hadn't convinced Hideyo to explain to him how her towers maintained their perpetual flame.

Between Hokko's inner and outer wall lay the village farmlands. Many of the terraced rice paddies had been drained to accommodate the rebellion's forces. For nearly three months, tents and cook fires had sprawled around the village. At roughly two hundred soldiers, the rebellion almost doubled Hokko's population. Thankfully, they brought enough rations to sustain themselves.

When Mamoru reached Hideyo on the inner wall, she was already listening to a beleaguered soldier with a long, black braid down his back. By the bandage on his arm and the ragged condition of his clothing, Mamoru guessed it was a member of the southern forces. 

"--no more than a couple days ahead. Maybe less--." The dark-haired soldier quieted as Mamoru approached.

Hideyo turned and looked over her shoulder. She acknowledged Mamoru with a curt nod and turned back to the soldier. "It's OK, he can hear this too. Go ahead and start from the beginning, if you don't mind."

"Yes, sir. I'm the new leader of the southern detachment. Umako is dead. We were traveling north, escorting the heavier weaponry you had built while you all moved ahead to pursue Tsukuyomi. While we were crossing the mountains we were ambushed. We were eventually overrun and forced to abandon the weapons. We've been fleeing north ever since, taking heavy losses. About 80 of us are still alive, of that, probably only 60 are able to fight. The enemy forces are no more than a couple days behind us."

Hideyo's face was stern and hard to read. Since taking over the rebellion, she had become increasingly detached. The timid woman had been scoured away as she fought desperately to protect Yoshinobu's legacy. "80 survivors from an initial force of 300. And armed with our heavy weaponry, no less. This must have been quite the force. Kitsune?"

The man nodded. "Not just the foxes, though. Tengu as well. Plus a couple dragons."

Hideyo's eyes widened slightly. "Ninigi and Amaterasu have joined with Tsukuyomi as well, then. Were any of the three gods present during the fighting?"

"No, sir. But there was a woman who fought alongside them. Before she showed up we thought we had a chance to hold." The man shook his head. "I've never seen anything like what she did. Not even from you and the rest of the commanders. She took out 50 men on her own."

"Did she fight with a bow?" The man nodded. "We're aware of her. Is there anything else?" Hideyo dismissed the man when he shook his head. As he walked away, Hideyo turned to Mamoru, her short form suddenly looked very weary.

"Well, your friend has been busy."

Mamoru's mind was reeling. "There must be some sort of mistake, or something's gone wrong with Chiyoko's plan."

"Mamoru. Chiyoko doesn't have a secret plan. She _betrayed_ us." Hideyo's face twisted in anger, but she quickly let the emotion fade. She held up a hand. "No, it doesn't matter. There's no reason to have this fight again. We've lost."

"What are you talking about? We can't give up now."

"Did you hear him? We were relying on those soldiers and those weapons. And that was just to defend against Tsukuyomi. If there were tengu and dragons attacking, then at least three of the gods have decided to pursue us. And that's not even talking about Chiyoko. You saw what she was capable of when we fought Tsukuyomi. So unless that newfound strength you got from Tsukuyomi's possession is a _lot_ more than you've let on, how exactly do you suggest we get out of this?"

Mamoru stared at Hideyo, unable to find an answer.

The woman shrugged. "The best we can do is get the villagers out of here. If we can dig in and hold on long enough, we might be able to give you a big enough head start to get away. You'll have to leave immediately. I'll have the soldiers round up enough rations for all of you. We won't be needing them much longer."

"I'm not leaving you here to die Hideyo. We all go together or we all stand and fight."

"Mamoru, there's no reason everyone has to die. The gods are going to pursue the rebellion no matter what. But what do they care about your village? You could save them. You could save Katsumi."

"Why are you all so intent on giving up? I'm not letting Tsukuyomi get away with what he's done and I'm not leaving others behind. What's the point in living if you can only do it by running from everything you care about?"

"You're being shortsighted, Mamoru. Even if you lose everything now, you can always rebuild as long as you're alive. But when you die you're just... gone." Hideyo looked down quickly, tears in her eyes.

Mamoru softened his shoulders, tears ran down his cheeks as he watched Hideyo struggling to regain her composure. He reached out and pulled Hideyo into a hug. "I'm sorry, Hideyo. I didn't mean to... I'm not saying we should all throw our lives away carelessly." Mamoru held the hug for a few heartbeats. Hideyo did not cry, but he felt her body relax after a moment. "We all miss him. You can see how it affected the soldiers. I wish I'd had more time to get to know him."

The two pulled back, Mamoru wiping his eyes with the back of his hands. "But you don't have to do this alone. Our best chance is together."

"Mamoru... we have _no_ chance. The odds were stacked against us when we were only going after Tsukuyomi. I'm not just trying to pointlessly martyr myself here. We pulled you into this mess, at least now we can make sure you and your village escape."

"You all _are_ my village, Hideyo. Once we let anyone through those walls, we look out for them. You can ask anyone in Hokko. Besides, where would we go? 300 people wandering through the forest don't have any chance to survive either."

Hideyo shook her head, laughing incredulously. "It's... The odds are just _so_ overwhelming. Three gods surrounded by all their followers.  Not even Yosh would have tried, I think."

Mamoru paused, thoughtful. "Don't you think it's a little _too_ overwhelming?"

"What do you mean?"

"Think about it. When we came staggering back here three months ago, Seiji and Katsumi were completely out. Hokko was a ruin. We had no defensive fortifications. Tsukuyomi was right next to his domain. Why didn't he just gather his followers and overwhelm us straight away? Why be so methodical? That doesn't sound like him at all. It sounds more like... Chiyoko, don't you think?"

Hideyo sneered. "What's the difference?"

"There _is_ a difference. I know you don't trust her. But just think about it logically for a minute. Even if Chiyoko is grabbing for power, she has no reason to _want_ to destroy Hokko. I think she's been trying to keep the confrontation away from us as long she could." 

"Why, though?"

"You said it yourself, the gods can't let the rebellion keep going. Chiyoko probably can't stop them attacking us, but she knows if they come in a bunch of smaller waves we'll try to fight. And we'll just keep fighting until we die. She wants it to be obvious it's over. I think she's trying to tell us to surrender - she must have some sort of plan!"

"Or she just wants us to surrender so they win without a fight. But... either way, you have a point. It does sound like we're being set up to surrender, rather than just be killed outright."

"Exactly!"

"Look, Mamoru, I don't think Chiyoko has some master plan and she's going to suddenly be on our side. But it doesn't really matter at this point. We only ever had a chance when the gods thought they were just toying with us. If they're taking it seriously now, well, giving up is better than dying. 

"I'll have everyone hole up inside the walls and prepare to surrender. On the off chance Chiyoko does something, we'll be ready. But if we're wrong and everyone stays here... are you sure you want to take that risk?"

Mamoru nodded without hesitation. "Chiyoko's got a plan. I trust her."

<br />

Two days later, the rebellion waited within Hokko's inner walls. Soldiers lined the ramparts and manned the defensive towers Hideyo had built. More fighters stood grouped by the gate, armed and ready. Flying from the wall were several white flags. Hideyo, Mamoru, and Katsumi stood side by side on the ground outside the gate. Seiji was still within the village, lying comatose in a building at the center of town.

They watched, alone save for each other, as they saw just how overwhelming the gods' army was.

Kitsune swarmed from the trees, leaping onto Hokko's outer wall and then dropping into the terraces below. They were primarily single-tailed, human sized foxes. Though there was a smattering of two- and three-tails. A single four-tailed kitsune, it's fur closer to gold in color moved at the head, leading the other beasts. It stood nearly twice as tall as the one-tails.

Following behind the kitsune were twenty red-skinned creatures. They looked like humans save for the wings at their back and the six inch long noses extending from their face. They wore formal armor, much like Seiji's, and carried long golden staffs topped with a loop of jangling rings. Like the foxes before them, they leapt atop the wall easily, gesturing forward with their staffs. Tengu generals.

Swarming behind them came came a horde of child-sized crow people. Their bodies were covered in black feathers. They wore brown leather trousers over their taloned legs, but their upper bodies were bare, their arms - more like wings - free to move. They were constantly cawing from long, hooked beaks. The crow tengu soldiers flew over the wall and came to rest amongst the kitsune, shifting restlessly.

Simply emerging from the forest took the army a considerable time. The creatures kept coming, fanning out and filling the upper terrace levels. Eventually, the tide began to slow and the full army could be seen arrayed at the top of the valley, looking down on the rebellion huddled within Hokko. The force was nearly 500 strong.

Katsumi looked disappointed. "I thought you said there would be dragons to fight as well. I do not wish to die swarmed by all these insects."

Mamoru looked at her with concern. "We're not fighting Kats. Just remember--."

As he spoke, a series of roars emerged from the forest, quieting him. From deeper in the forrest, five long, reptilian forms emerged from the trees, their sinewy forms swimming through the air like snakes in water. Each dragon's scales were a different color, with a row of gems lining their back in a row of spikes. There was a blue dragon, with a back lined in sapphires, a red covered in rubies, white with diamonds, black with onyx, and greet with emeralds. Their heads were wide, with long whiskers like a catfish shifting in the air. Their short, taloned legs flexed absently as they twisted lazily about one another in the air. Each dragon was nearly 30 feet long.

Katsumi watched them arrive with a smile.

Mamoru shifted uncomfortably. "Chiyoko has a plan. She's going to do something." Even the hulking forms of him and Katsumi seemed frail looking up at the army arrayed before them.

Ten minutes passed. Then twenty. The rebels along the wall began to shift uncomfortably. Their resolve weakening as they were left to watch the mass of snapping, snarling creatures in front of them.

Eventually, there was a ripple amongst the trees at the back of the surrounding army. Creatures shifted out of the way as Tsukuyomi's white-furred form emerged from the trees. Standing over twenty feet tall, he simply stepped over the wall. Dropping to the ground and walking beside him was a familiar, dark haired woman.

"Chiyoko!" Mamoru's face brightened.

Chiyoko and Tsukuyomi walked to the head of the army, dropping to a terrace below their forces. Chiyoko noticed Mamoru and the others standing by the wall and beckoned them towards her with a hand.

Mamoru immediately began to approach, but Hideyo put out her arm. "Wait, it could be a trap. What if they're just trying to take out the three biggest threats before the fight begins? They should come to us."

On the other side of Mamoru, Katsumi began to walk forward. "If I die today, it will be surrounded by enemies, ripping out the throat of one of those dragons. Cower by the wall like a little mouse if you must."

Hideyo blinked, stung by the words. Mamoru pushed past her and joined Katsumi, drawing his axe from over his shoulder.

Hideyo hesitated a moment longer. "That woman is going to get us all killed." Reluctantly she trotted after them, moving quickly to catch up.

Tsukuyomi sat behind Chiyoko, his tails billowing about him. His ice-blue eyes glistening in the cold morning light. Chiyoko stood five feet in front. She looked the same as she always had save for her eyes. They were the same blue as the god's.

The air was noticeably colder as Mamoru and the others pulled themselves onto the terrace and stood face to face with the pair.

"I told you the knight could not survive the blow I dealt him. What will you tell Ninigi now?" Tsukuyomi's deep voice was filled with amusement as he spoke.

Chiyoko looked to Hideyo. "Is it true? Where is Seiji?" She looked tense.

Hideyo was silent, glaring at Chiyoko. Mamoru stepped forward. "He's alive. But he's still unconscious." 

One of Tsukuyomi's tails arced forward slowly in front of the Tsukuyomi's face. His eyes turned towards the tail, ignoring the group for a moment. "Unconscious? A shame."

There was silence for a time. No one seemed to know what to say. Mamoru and the others remained tense, ready to move at a moment's notice. Eventually, Hideyo broke the silence. "We're prepared to fight if we have to. But as you can see by the flags along our wall, we're ready to surrender. Are you here to discuss terms?"

Chiyoko relaxed. "Good. Yes, we're here to discuss terms. Though I don't think they'll be what you're expecting."

Mamoru nodded knowingly. His hand tightened on the shaft of his axe and he glared at Tsukuyomi, preparing to leap.

"I've talked with the gods. They wanted to kill you all to avoid future conflicts. The game was no longer fun to them. But I convinced them of a different path. They're willing to let everyone live on two conditions. The army has to disband, obviously. But the remaining leaders of the rebellion - you three and Seiji - must pledge yourselves to the gods, serving them and helping to suppress any future dissent."

Mamoru paused, letting his axe drop slightly. "Huh?"

Hideyo finally tore gaze from Chiyoko. Her eyes narrowed as she turned them towards Tsukuyomi, who was still in the process of inspecting his tail. "I second Mamoru's confusion. That seems... strangely lenient. What's to stop us from turning on you at the first opportunity? A promise can be broken. Why take that risk? What do you get out of this deal? "

Tsukuyomi looked back down to the dwarven woman. The ground rumbled as he chuckled. "My my. She's gotten one good shot at slaying me and now she assumes it will happen again. It took an army, led by the six strongest members of your people, _years_ just to find one opportunity. And you failed." Tsukuyomi's lips pulled back in a smile, showing too many teeth. "So please go on about this great risk we're taking.

"As for what we gain, the answer is time. Now that this diversion has reached its end, we planned to wipe the slate clean. Rebellion was fun. Now we'd like to try something new. But starting from scratch is so _slow_. Yosai is quite boring when it's empty. With you lot serving us, we don't have to start over, but we also don't have to waste our time policing the five races. 

"You'd have us serve him? Listen to how he talks about the five races. Like pieces in a game. At least if we die now, others can try to fight in our place. If we join the gods, their control will be absolute."

"I--." Chiyoko sighed in frustration. "There's so much to explain! Let me start with this." Chiyoko pointed to her eyes, shining blue. "Tsukuyomi explained to me where we all get our powers. We each have a bond with a source of energy somewhere in the world. When we use our abilities, we're drawing from whatever that source of energy is. Mamoru, take your strength for example. It probably comes from the people of Hokko."

Mamoru blinked, clearly confused by the direction the conversation was going. "What does this have to do with anything right now?"

"It has _everything_ to do with right now!" Chiyoko's eyes flashed, feral for a moment before she calmed herself. "Everything hinges on this. You see, in order for a bond to form, you have to be ideologically similar to whatever the source of power is. Mamoru, your loyalty embodies this town. Everyone takes care of everyone else. And because you believe that to your core, you're able to draw energy from the people around you. And the more power you draw from your bond, the more strongly you come to embody the ideal created it. 

"But your bond can _change_ if your ideals change. Or if you find a different source of energy that shares similar ideals. That's what happened to me. I kept putting my trust in others and it kept leading to the things I cared about getting hurt. I was frustrated with Yoshinobu and how he was putting people's lives in danger. How he was putting your life in danger." Chiyoko looked to Mamoru. "I decided I had to protect the things I cared about myself. And when I made that decision, I started to resonate with Tsukuyomi.

"That's why the bonds are so important. I couldn't convince the gods to let you go free. You're all too powerful. But if each of you can shift your bond to one of them, they'll let you live. You're not just making a promise to serve. Over time, it will change who you are. That's why they're not worried."

"My point still stands then. If we save ourselves, the five races will be subjugated forever."

"It won't be that way. Yes, no one will be able to overthrow the gods. But we won't have to. These bonds I'm talking about, the changes they create go in both directions. We'll become more like the gods, but they'll also become more like us. And those changes will ripple through all the beasts they've created." Chiyoko gestured at the gods' army above them. "The rebellion was never going to succeed. But even if it had, what happened after we killed the gods? We'd still be trapped in the vicious playground they built for us. This is the only way we can actually build a future that doesn't destroy everything in the process."

Hideyo paused, considering Chiyoko's words.

Mamoru took another step forward, looking between Hideyo and Chiyoko. Eventually his gaze settled on Chiyoko, looking into her eyes. "The two of you are so focused on what comes at the end. You always keep your eyes forward, looking to where we're going. That's why you were always the better tracker than me.

"But we can't just focus on the outcome. Getting there, it shapes who we are. Whatever result we end up with, then we have to _live_ as the people who got to that point. Hideyo wanted me to abandon her so that the villagers in Hokko could survive. But then we would be a village of people who abandon their friends to save themselves. You want us to pledge ourselves to the gods. But then we would be a race who bows to tyrants. We would give them everything, despite what they've done, so long as they give us a choice we can't refuse.

"We can't just strive for a perfect world. We have to deserve it when we get there." Mamoru took one last look at Chiyoko. He smiled sadly. Then he turned, facing the giant fox god behind her. "You killed my mother. Make whatever deals you want with them when we're done, but I will not bow to you." 

Mamoru gripped his axe, knuckles white. He raised the weapon over his head and roared, the muscles on his body surging. The ground beneath his feet shattered as he leapt with all his might towards the god.

He moved faster than anyone in the group could react. Even Tsukuyomi seemed caught off guard. As he flew through the air, Mamoru's axe began to spark. Small pulses of electricity flared to life across the blade, disappearing just as quickly.

Arcing out of the woods, directly towards Mamoru's hand, lightning struck.

As the bolt of electricity connected with Mamoru's hand, the energy condensed, forming a hand. The bolt flared, blinding everyone as it materialized into a gigantic human form holding Mamoru's wrist. Mamoru's arm wrenched as his momentum was completely halted.

"Whoo! What a speech!" With their free hand, the creature clapped against their forearm, causing Mamoru to shake in the air. "Right before dramatically leaping to your death, too!" Their voice crackled and distorted like static shocks off a blanket. They had the shape of a human, though they were nearly 15 feet tall. A cloak covered their body, hood up. Their lean muscled limbs were wrapped tightly in bandages. A porcelain mask covered their face. Across the blank white surface of the mask, electricity crawled, forming eyes and a mouth that moved in conjunction with the creature's words.

Chiyoko reacted before the rest. In a blur of movement, she pulled the bow from her hip as she turned towards the new creature. The air popped as she pulled an ice arrow into exist and took aim. "Put him _down_ Susano." 

Susano lifted Mamoru by the arm, bringing his face to their own. Despite Mamoru's bulk, they seemed to moved him with ease. "Relax. I like this one!" There was a crack in the air as the creature and Mamoru disappeared in a flash of electricity. They reappeared ten feet away, standing on the other side of Tsukuyomi. The creature now held Mamoru around the shoulders with both hands. "I choose him." They planted Mamoru on the ground roughly, the ground buckling under Mamoru's feet as he absorbed the shock with his legs.

Susano peered around the nine tailed fox's shoulder. "Leave it to you to pick the most dramatic one, Tsuk." The electricity arcing across their face formed into a tongue sticking out at Chiyoko.

One of Tsukuyomi's tails flicked forward and snapped across the back of Susano's head lightly. "And leave it to you to pick the biggest fool." Tsukuyomi growled at Mamoru briefly.

Susano rubbed the back of their head. "Ow! Sheesh what was that for. Hey, what'd you think of the entrance? Pretty cool, right?" Tsukuyomi rolled his eyes.

Chiyoko sighed, relaxing her bow and standing out of her crouch. Mamoru still seemed stunned by the sudden change in circumstances, but Hideyo and Katsumi were both tensed, ready. to attack. The ice arrow dissipated in Chiyoko's hand as she raised it in a calming gesture. "It's OK, we're still just here to talk." Chiyoko turned back towards the woods and raised her voice. "I guess you all might as well come out now."

There was more movement amongst the gods' army as two more figures emerged from the tree. The first was a man similar in height to Susano, but more solidly built. His skin was like burnished silver and he wore immaculate white robes. Six diamond shaped pieces of metal, each a different type, orbited his head like a halo. Ninigi, The Emperor.

Beside him, slightly taller, walked a woman with rough, brown skin made of bark. Her clothes were a chaotic weave of vines and leaves. Sharply pointed antlers, three feet in length, emerged from her forehead. Around them, long brown hair flowed to the woman's waist. Pink flowers were continually blossoming and wilting in her hair, the dead petals trailing behind her. Sakuya, The Woodheart.

Above them, the trees rustled as a massive serpentine form emerged. Floating through the air was an enormous, golden dragon. It was similar in shape to the dragons that floated about the army, but over twice as large. As she flew, the air around the dragon periodically ignited into ribbons of flame. Amaterasu, The Dawnforge.

The three came to rest near Susano and Tsukuyomi. Arrayed behind Chiyoko were the five gods of Yosai.

Hideyo took a step backwards, overwhelmed by the gods' appearance. Seeing her step backwards, Amaterasu - the giant gold dragon - flowed towards Hideyo. Hideyo's hands ignited reflexively. She held them the flames in front of her defensively.

The Dawnforge continued, swirling around Hideyo. As she did, the flames leapt from Hideyo's hands of their own accord, joining the random bursts of flame already swirling around the dragon.

"You are the one who built those towers below, yes? Chiyoko has told me about you. About the things you create. I have been so _disappointed_ with the five races. All you do is destroy and consume. When we shaped you, I had such hopes for what you would build."

Hideyo looked around nervously as the god encircled her. Sweat formed on her brow from the heat of the dragon's body.

Susano bent at the waist, looking down at Mamoru between their legs. A small jolt of energy arced to Mamoru's shoulder from the god's finger tip. Mamoru tensed. "Hey, wasn't there supposed to be another one of you?"

"I... uh... Seiji is unconscious. In the village." Mamoru's fury had left him completely, overwhelmed by the rapid developments.

Chiyoko turned towards Susano, the ground beneath her feet frosting ominously. "You will not treat him like a plaything, Stormbringer. I told you this before." To her left, Tsukuyomi growled softly, adding weight to her words. 

Susano held both of their hands up in front of them. "Woah! Lighten up! I'm just getting to know the guy." Susano stepped to the side of Mamoru and patted his back with a massive hand. There was another spark and Mamoru jumped forwards. "Whoops! Sorry. Really - I've just never tried to _not_ do it before."

As Mamoru walked towards Hideyo and Katsumi, Susano pointed a finger at Ninigi's spinning metal halo and arced a lightning bolt to it. "Hey Ninigi, wasn't Seiji the one you were interested in? Sounds like you got the weak one!" Ninigi caught the lightning bolt in his hand, ignoring Susano's comment. 

The giant gold dragon stopped circling Hideyo and swam through the air to Susano, wrapping around them. Unlike when she was circling Hideyo, the Dawnforge let her body, and the flames around her, connect with Susano. They yelped and there was a crack as their body shifted to lightning. It reappeared outside the dragon's embrace. There was a warmth to Amaterasu's voice as she spoke to Susano. "Always causing trouble."

When Mamoru passed Chiyoko, she caught him, placing a hand on his thickly muscled chest. She caught his eyes. "I know you could never work with Tsukuyomi, Mamoru. I'm not asking you to. Susano may seem crazy, but they're loyal. They believe much of what you do. Right now the Stormbringer is callous and unthinking, but if you guide them... I think you would like what they become."

Mamoru placed a hand over Chiyoko's. "It doesn't matter, I can't support that beast, even indirectly." Mamoru looked over Chiyoko's shoulder at Tsukuyomi.

"You won't be." Chiyoko turned her back on the gods and spoke to the rest of the group. "There's still one part of the terms I haven't mentioned yet. We don't just have to wait and hope our bonds make the gods grow a conscience. They wanted a new game to hold their interest, so I proposed one. A competition. Between _them_.

"The gods have agreed to a set of rules. When we bond with them, we will each be given a domain, an area that we have complete control over. None of the gods, or the creatures they've created will be allowed to interfere within that domain. Even outside of our domains, gods and their creatures must offer any member of the five races a _reasonable_ challenge before they doing anything that would cause that person harm. If the person passes the challenge, they must be left alone.

"In exchange, we will train and cultivate powerful people to go out into the world and face those challenges. As they do, they will grow stronger. Whenever one of those people becomes strong enough, they must pledge themselves to a god, the same as us. And then they'll be given their own domain, increasing the influence of the god they've joined."

Ninigi spoke for the first time. His voice deep and solemn. "We will battle for control of Yosai."

Chiyoko continued, excited. "And because of the rules, the people of Yosai will mostly be protected. We'll have control of our domains, able to shield them from the chaos that everyone lives in now. And new people who show promise can test themselves and grow their power beyond the protection of our domains." Chiyoko lowered her voice and spoke so only Mamoru could hear. "You can still work to oppose Tsukuyomi. You can even try to kill him. It will be part of the game. And if you bond with Susano, you'll have more power to fight the fox with. _Please_ Mamoru."

He paused, looking down at her thoughtfully. Hideyo also seemed to be considering her words.

Katsumi had been silent until now. "You are very convincing. But I do not bow to _words_." The shapeshifter pointed a hand at the bark-skinned woman standing silently beside Ninigi. Katsumi's finger grew long and sharp. "You. All the others have laid claim, so I assume you mean for me to join you?"

Sakuya turned, wilted cherry blossoms falling from her hair as new ones sprung up to take their place. "I care little for this proposal. I would prefer we wipe the land clean, rather than let you weeds continue taking root. But I was outvoted. So yes, I guess we will be playing this game together."

"No. I will not bow to you because you asked. Or to help the five races. I do not fight to save others. I fight because a predator kills. If you wish for me to follow you, then don't let me kill you." Katsumi leaned forward, her body swelling in size. Her arms elongated as her legs bent the wrong direction. She shook her body and grey fur erupted, completing her transformation into a ten foot tall grey wolf.

Katsumi howled and began to circle Sakuya.

Someone says "Katsumi stop this! you don't stand a chance!" Ninigi says something like "she must learn her place, I respect that" to show love of order.
