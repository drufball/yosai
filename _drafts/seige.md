Mamoru paused in front of the door. He took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders a few times, steeling himself for the confrontation ahead. He pulled a cloth binding from the satchel at his side and draped it across one arm. He pressed his coarse hair flat with his free hand.

He knocked, wincing as his knuckles wrapped against the wood.

There was a crash as something smashed against the other side of the door. "You will not touch me again, Hideyo!"

Mamoru pushed the door open slightly and waved his hand through the crack. "Kats! It's me, not Hideyo." Mamoru made sure the bandage remained behind the door.

There was a moment of silence. "Come in."

Mamoru slid through the doorway, closing it carefully. The room he stepped into was small and windowless. The ceiling was tall enough for Mamoru to stand at his full six and a half feet, but short enough that he slouched reflexively. A small fire pit smoldered in the corner, coating the wall in soot. 

Functional was the only word that could be applied to the buildings in Hokko.

The rest of the room was dominated by layers of animal furs arranged into a bed. Katsumi sat amongst them, her back propped against the wall. When she saw the bandage in Mamoru's other hand, her eyes narrowed.

"She sent you, didn't she."

"Kats, we've been over this. Hideyo is just trying to help."

"A hawk does not seek help from a _mouse_."

Mamoru sighed as he knelt down beside Katsumi. "How are you feeling?"

"I feel fine. It's been three months. I am ready to leave."

"Hideyo says you need another week or two. Her magic stitched you up, but your body isn't done strengthening the threads. Can I take a look?"

Katsumi nodded and pulled her rough-spun shirt over her head. She wore nothing underneath. Mamoru took a moment to admire her thickly muscled arms, her powerful shoulders. His eyes lingered on her breasts. Katsumi watched him as he looked at her.

He blushed and shifted his gaze to the bandages wrapped around the shapeshifter's midsection. "I, uh... I need to look at the... can I remove the..." He shifted his hands awkwardly, reaching towards the bandages and quickly pulling them away.

Katsumi snorted. "Like a frightened dear every time." She raised her arms over her head.

Mamoru set the new bandage on the furs next to him, careful not to contaminate the thick poultice smeared across it. He moved closer to Katsumi. With delicate fingers he untied the knot on the old binding. His arms wrapped around her waist as he unwound the bandage. Her hands rested on his shoulders as he worked, their faces inches apart. Their breathing quickened.

Mamoru finished removing the bandage. A fist-sized, angry red scar obscured Katsumi's otherwise well-defined abs. Mamoru's fingers rested against scar, still looking into Katsumi's eyes. His hand moved upwards hesitantly, trailing along Katsumi's skin. She pulled him towards her.

Katsumi kissed like she fought. She used her strength to move Mamoru where she wanted, pulling his body onto hers. Mamoru tensed in surprise as she bit his lip. But he quickly adjusted, letting the energy overtake him as well. Mamoru grabbed one of Katsumi's hands resting at the back of his neck and pushed it against the wall behind her. Lost in the moment, his hand moved faster than he expected, slamming her hand into the wall harder than he intended. She winced briefly.

Mamoru pulled back like a man avoiding a blow. "Ah, sorry! I'm still getting used to--."

Katsumi reached out and grabbed him, pulling him back towards her. "Don't insult me with your concern."

But Mamoru pressed a hand against the wall, holding himself back. "No, this is a bad idea. I'm still not used to the strength Tsukuyomi left inside me. I could hurt you." Mamoru pulled himself a way with visible reluctance.

Katsumi growled and brought her hands down in frustration. "I am not as _fragile_ as you think I am."

"I know you're not fragile, Kats. But you _are_ injured. Accepting one doesn't require the other." Mamoru clasped his hands behind his head. "I already did _this_ to you. I'd rather not make it worse." 

There was a long silence as the two regained their composure.

"You want to wait until I am fully recovered. But when that time comes, I will leave."

Mamoru's face fell. "You still want to leave? But the rebellion needs you."

"The rebellion is dead, Mamoru. It died when your friend shot Yoshinobu in the heart." Katsumi looked towards the coals of the fire. "It's time I found my own battles again."

"The rebellion isn't dead. We still have the three of us. And Seiji once he wakes up. We have the army here. Hideyo says more should be coming up from the south soon." Mamoru paused for a moment. "And Chiyoko. I don't know what her plan is, but she has one. That's how she always was, growing up. Three steps ahead of me."

"You are a fool. Chiyoko struck because she was strong and Yoshinobu was weak. That's how the world works."

"That's not how _she_ works."

"Regardless. I did not join the rebellion because these people _needed_ me. I joined to fight. Without Yoshinobu, the army thinks only of defense."

"It won't always be that way, though." Mamoru picked up the new bandage and began to wind it around Katsumi. She did not move to stop him, but neither did she look back from the fire.

"It's been three months and all Hideyo has done is strengthen the walls and build defenses. There is no fire in the soldier's eyes. Only fear and sadness. If I stay here I may as well be a beast in a cage."

"What about us?" Mamoru caught himself and quickly added. "If you leave you'll never get your chance for a rematch, I mean."

"I have said that you may join me."

"You know I can't leave the people here."

"And you know I cannot stay."

Mamoru finished wrapping Katsumi's bandage in silence, unsure what to say. Eventually he finished and the two sat next to each other, their shoulders touching. The mood fell into to a comfortable silence.

After a few minutes, the pair was broken from their reverie by a knock at the door. "Mamoru, sir. Hideyo has asked that you meet her on the walls." One of the soldiers from the rebellion. No one from Hokko would ever call Mamoru sir.

"Can it wait?"

"I don't think so, sir. The rest of our forces just arrived from the south. Most of them are dead."

<br />

Mamoru hurried through the village, his breath fogging in the perpetual cold. A soldier had pointed him in the direction of Hideyo and he made his way as directly as he could, picking through the busy village.

Hokko was still littered with piles of rubble from the battle with Tsukuyomi four months ago. But the rebellion soldiers had helped rebuild several of the single-story, thatched roof buildings. A group of men and women were splitting tree trunks that had been piled at the village center, preparing them to use for further repairs. They discussed the newly arrived soldiers in nervous whispers.

Slender pyramids built from wood dotted the perimeter of Hokko, just inside the inner wall. Each tower had a series of interlocking gears working from the base of the structure up to a large metal sphere covered in holes. Periodically, a small gout of flame would erupt from one of the openings. Mamoru still hadn't convinced Hideyo to explain to him how her towers maintained their perpetual flame.

Between Hokko's inner and outer wall lay the village farmlands. Many of the terraced rice paddies had been drained to accommodate the rebellion's forces. For nearly three months, tents and cook fires had sprawled around the village. At roughly two hundred soldiers, the rebellion almost doubled Hokko's population. Thankfully, they brought enough rations to sustain themselves.

When Mamoru reached Hideyo on the inner wall, she was already listening to a beleaguered soldier with a long, black braid down his back. By the bandage on his arm and the ragged condition of his clothing, Mamoru guessed it was a member of the southern forces. 

"--no more than a couple days ahead. Maybe less--." The dark-haired soldier quieted as Mamoru approached.

Hideyo turned and looked over her shoulder. She acknowledged Mamoru with a curt nod and turned back to the soldier. "It's OK, he can hear this too. Go ahead and start from the beginning, if you don't mind."

"Yes, sir. I'm the new leader of the southern detachment. Umako is dead. We were traveling north, escorting the heavier weaponry you had built while you all moved ahead to pursue Tsukuyomi. While we were crossing the mountains we were ambushed. We were eventually overrun and forced to abandon the weapons. We've been fleeing north ever since, taking heavy losses. About 80 of us are still alive, of that, probably only 60 are able to fight. The enemy forces are no more than a couple days behind us."

Hideyo's face was stern and hard to read. Since taking over the rebellion, she had become increasingly detached. The timid woman had been scoured away as she fought desperately to protect Yoshinobu's legacy. "80 survivors from an initial force of 300. And armed with our heavy weaponry, no less. This must have been quite the force. Kitsune?"

The man nodded. "Not just the foxes, though. Tengu as well. Plus a couple dragons."

Hideyo's eyes widened slightly. "Ninigi and Amaterasu have joined with Tsukuyomi as well, then. Were any of the three gods present during the fighting?"

"No, sir. But there was a woman who fought alongside them. Before she showed up we thought we had a chance to hold." The man shook his head. "I've never seen anything like what she did. Not even from you and the rest of the commanders. She took out 50 men on her own."

"Did she fight with a bow?" The man nodded. "We're aware of her. Is there anything else?" Hideyo dismissed the man when he shook his head. As he walked away, Hideyo turned to Mamoru, her short form suddenly looked very weary.

"Well, your friend has been busy."

Mamoru's mind was reeling. "There must be some sort of mistake, or something's gone wrong with Chiyoko's plan."

"Mamoru. Chiyoko doesn't have a secret plan. She _betrayed_ us." Hideyo's face twisted in anger, but she quickly let the emotion fade. She held up a hand. "No, it doesn't matter. There's no reason to have this fight again. We've lost."

"What are you talking about? We can't give up now."

"Did you hear him? We were relying on those soldiers and those weapons. And that was just to defend against Tsukuyomi. If there were tengu and dragons attacking, then at least three of the gods have decided to pursue us. And that's not even talking about Chiyoko. You saw what she was capable of when we fought Tsukuyomi. So unless that newfound strength you got from Tsukuyomi's possession is a _lot_ more than you've let on, how exactly do you suggest we get out of this?"

Mamoru stared at Hideyo, unable to find an answer.

The woman shrugged. "The best we can do is get the villagers out of here. If we can dig in and hold on long enough, we might be able to give you a big enough head start to get away. You'll have to leave immediately. I'll have the soldiers round up enough rations for all of you. We won't be needing them much longer."

"I'm not leaving you here to die Hideyo. We all go together or we all stand and fight."

"Mamoru, there's no reason everyone has to die. The gods are going to pursue the rebellion no matter what. But what do they care about your village? You could save them. You could save Katsumi."

"Why are you all so intent on giving up? I'm not letting Tsukuyomi get away with what he's done and I'm not leaving others behind. What's the point in living if you can only do it by running from everything you care about?"

"You're being shortsighted, Mamoru. Even if you lose everything now, you can always rebuild as long as you're alive. But when you die you're just... gone." Hideyo looked down quickly, tears in her eyes.

Mamoru softened his shoulders, tears ran down his cheeks as he watched Hideyo struggling to regain her composure. He reached out and pulled Hideyo into a hug. "I'm sorry, Hideyo. I didn't mean to... I'm not saying we should all throw our lives away carelessly." Mamoru held the hug for a few heartbeats. Hideyo did not cry, but he felt her body relax after a moment. "We all miss him. You can see how it affected the soldiers. I wish I'd had more time to get to know him."

The two pulled back, Mamoru wiping his eyes with the back of his hands. "But you don't have to do this alone. Our best chance is together."

"Mamoru... we have _no_ chance. The odds were stacked against us when we were only going after Tsukuyomi. I'm not just trying to pointlessly martyr myself here. We pulled you into this mess, at least now we can make sure you and your village escape."

"You all _are_ my village, Hideyo. Once we let anyone through those walls, we look out for them. You can ask anyone in Hokko. Besides, where would we go? 300 people wandering through the forest don't have any chance to survive either."

Hideyo shook her head, laughing incredulously. "It's... The odds are just _so_ overwhelming. Three gods surrounded by all their followers.  Not even Yosh would have tried, I think."

Mamoru paused, thoughtful. "Don't you think it's a little _too_ overwhelming?"

"What do you mean?"

"Think about it. When we came staggering back here three months ago, Seiji and Katsumi were completely out. Hokko was a ruin. We had no defensive fortifications. Tsukuyomi was right next to his domain. Why didn't he just gather his followers and overwhelm us straight away? Why be so methodical? That doesn't sound like him at all. It sounds more like... Chiyoko, don't you think?"

Hideyo sneered. "What's the difference?"

"There _is_ a difference. I know you don't trust her. But just think about it logically for a minute. Even if Chiyoko is grabbing for power, she has no reason to _want_ to destroy Hokko. I think she's been trying to keep the confrontation away from us as long she could." 

"Why, though?"

"You said it yourself, the gods can't let the rebellion keep going. Chiyoko probably can't stop them attacking us, but she knows if they come in a bunch of smaller waves we'll try to fight. And we'll just keep fighting until we die. She wants it to be obvious it's over. I think she's trying to tell us to surrender - she must have some sort of plan!"

"Or she just wants us to surrender so they win without a fight. But... either way, you have a point. It does sound like we're being set up to surrender, rather than just be killed outright."

"Exactly!"

"Look, Mamoru, I don't think Chiyoko has some master plan and she's going to suddenly be on our side. But it doesn't really matter at this point. We only ever had a chance when the gods thought they were just toying with us. If they're taking it seriously now, well, giving up is better than dying. 

"I'll have everyone hole up inside the walls and prepare to surrender. On the off chance Chiyoko does something, we'll be ready. But if we're wrong and everyone stays here... are you sure you want to take that risk?"

Mamoru nodded without hesitation. "Chiyoko's got a plan. I trust her."

Two days later, the rebellion waited within Hokko's inner walls. Soldiers lined the ramparts and manned the defensive towers Hideyo had built. More fighters stood grouped by the gate, armed and ready. Flying from the wall were several white flags. Hideyo, Mamoru, and Katsumi stood side by side on the ground outside the gate. Seiji was still within the village, lying comatose in a building at the center of town.

They watched, alone save for each other, as they saw just how overwhelming the gods' army was.

Kitsune swarmed from the trees, leaping onto Hokko's outer wall and then dropping into the terraces below. They were primarily single-tailed, human sized foxes. Though there was a smattering of two- and three-tails. A single four-tailed kitsune, it's fur closer to gold in color moved at the head, leading the other beasts. It stood nearly twice as tall as the one-tails.

Following behind the kitsune were twenty red-skinned creatures. They looked like humans save for the wings at their back and the six inch long noses extending from their face. They wore formal armor, much like Seiji's, and carried long golden staffs topped with a loop of jangling rings. Like the foxes before them, they leapt atop the wall easily, gesturing forward with their staffs. Tengu generals.

Swarming behind them came came a horde of child-sized crow people. Their bodies were covered in black feathers. They wore brown leather trousers over their taloned legs, but their upper bodies were bare, their arms - more like wings - free to move. They were constantly cawing from long, hooked beaks. The crow tengu soldiers flew over the wall and came to rest amongst the kitsune, shifting restlessly.

Simply emerging from the forest took the army a considerable time. The creatures kept coming, fanning out and filling the upper terrace levels. Eventually, the tide began to slow and the full army could be seen arrayed at the top of the valley, looking down on the rebellion huddled within Hokko. The force was nearly 500 strong.

Katsumi looked disappointed. "I thought you said there would be dragons to fight as well. I do not wish to die swarmed by all these insects."

Mamoru looked at her with concern. "We're not fighting Kats. Just remember--."

As he spoke, a series of roars emerged from the forest, quieting him. From deeper in the forrest, five long, reptilian forms emerged from the trees, their sinewy forms swimming through the air like snakes in water. Each dragon's scales were a different color, with a row of gems lining their back in a row of spikes. There was a blue dragon, with a back lined in sapphires, a red covered in rubies, white with diamonds, black with onyx, and greet with emeralds. Their heads were wide, with long whiskers like a catfish shifting in the air. Their short, taloned legs flexed absently as the dragons began to twist lazily about one another in the air above the army.

Katsumi watched them arrive with a smile.

Mamoru shifted uncomfortably. "Chiyoko has a plan. She's going to do something." Even the hulking forms of him and Katsumi seemed frail looking up at the army arrayed before them.

Ten minutes passed. Then twenty. The rebels along the wall began to shift uncomfortably. Their resolve weakening as they were left to watch the mass of snapping, snarling creatures in front of them.

Eventually, there was a ripple amongst the trees at the back of the surrounding army. Creatures shifted out of the way as Tsukuyomi's white-furred form emerged from the trees. Standing over twenty feet tall, he simply stepped over the wall. Dropping to the ground and walking beside him was a familiar, dark haired woman.

"Chiyoko!" Mamoru's face brightened.

Chiyoko and Tsukuyomi walked to the head of the army, dropping to a terrace below their forces. Chiyoko noticed Mamoru and the others standing by the wall and beckoned them towards her with a hand.

Mamoru immediately began to approach, but Hideyo put out a hand. "Wait, it could be a trap. What if they're just trying to take out the three biggest threats before the fight begins. They should come to us."

On the other side of Mamoru, Katsumi began to walk forward. "If I die today, it will be surrounded by enemies, ripping out the throat of one of those dragons. Cower by the wall like a little mouse if you must."

Hideyo blinked, stung by the words. Mamoru pushed past her and joined Katsumi, drawing his axe from over his shoulder.

Hideyo hesitated a moment longer. "That woman is going to get us all killed." Reluctantly she trotted after them, moving quickly to catch up.

Tsukuyomi sat behind Chiyoko, his tails billowing about him. His ice-blue eyes glistening. Chiyoko stood five feet in front. She looked the same as she always had save for her eyes. They were the same blue as the god's.

The air was noticeably colder as Mamoru and the others pulled themselves onto the terrace and stood face to face with the pair.

"I told you the knight could not survive my strike. What will you tell Ninigi now?" Tsukuyomi's deep voice was filled with amusement as he spoke.

Chiyoko looked to Hideyo. "Is it true? Where is Seiji?" She looked tense.

Hideyo wasn't silent, glaring at Chiyoko. Mamoru stepped forward. "He's alive. But he's still unconscious." 

There was silence for a time. No one seemed to know what to say. Mamoru and the others remained tense, ready to move at a moment's notice. Eventually, Hideyo broke the silence. "We're prepared to fight if we have to. But as you can see by the flags along our wall, we're ready to surrender. Are you here to discuss terms?"

Chiyoko relaxed. "Good. Yes, we're here to discuss terms. Though I don't think they will be what you're expecting."

Mamoru nodded. His hand tightened on the shaft of his axe and he looked at Tsukuyomi, preparing to leap. This was it. The moment Chiyoko revealed her plan.

"I've talked with the gods. We're willing to let all of the soldiers go if they'll agree to giving up their weapons and being disbanded around Yosai. But for the leaders of the rebellion, they weren't willing to let you all roam freely. They're willing to let you live if you'll pledge yourselves to them."

Mamoru paused, letting his axe drop slightly. "Huh?"

"I--." Chiyoko sighed in frustration. "There's so much to explain! Let me start with this." Chiyoko pointed to her eyes, shining blue. "Tsukuyomi explained to me where we all get our powers. We each have some sort of bond with a source of energy somewhere in the world. When we use our abilities, we're drawing from whatever that source of energy is. Mamoru, take your strength for example. It probably comes from the people of Hokko."

Mamoru blinked, clearly confused by the direction the conversation was going. "You're saying I draw strength from the villagers? What are you talking about? What does this have to do with right now?"

"It has _everything_ to do with right now!" Chiyoko's eyes flashed, feral for a moment before she calmed herself. "Everything hinges on this. You see, in order for a bond to form, you have to be ideologically similar to whatever the source of power is. Mamoru, your loyalty embodies this town. Everyone takes care of everyone else. And because you believe that to your core, you're able to draw energy from the people around you. And the more power you draw from the bond, the more strongly you feel whatever ideal created it. 

"But your bond can change if your ideals change. Or if you find a different source of energy that shares similar ideals. That's what happened to me. I kept putting my trust in others and it kept leading to the things I cared about getting hurt. I was frustrated with Yoshinobu and how he was putting people's lives in danger. How he was putting your life in danger." Chiyoko looked to Mamoru. "I decided I had to protect the things I cared about myself. And when I made that decision, I started to resonate with Tsukuyomi.

"That's why the bonds are so important. I couldn't convince the gods to let you go free. You're all too powerful. But if you can shift your bond to one of them, they'll let you live."

Things to cover later: overwhelming force was so they would all give an earnest shot at resonating (no other option), Mamoru questions just serving the people they hate, chiyoko mentions how it will keep them safe and let the 5 races have some control over their own fate, mamoru pushes back - it's not just about the end result, attacks tsukuyomi, susano intervenes - picks mamoru, gods appear and banter, ninigi chooses seiji, hideyo + amaterasu, sakuya and katsumi but heads, fight time!
