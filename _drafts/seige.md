Mamoru paused in front of the door. He took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders a few times, steeling himself for the confrontation ahead. He pulled a cloth binding from the satchel at his side and draped it across one arm. He pressed his coarse hair flat with his free hand.

He knocked, wincing as his knuckles wrapped against the wood.

There was a crash as something smashed against the other side of the door. "You will not touch me again, Hideyo!"

Mamoru pushed the door open slightly and waved his hand through the crack. "Kats! It's me, not Hideyo." Mamoru made sure the bandage remained behind the door.

There was a moment of silence. "Come in."

Mamoru slid through the doorway, closing it carefully. The room he stepped into was small and windowless. The ceiling was tall enough for Mamoru to stand at his full six and a half feet, but short enough that he slouched reflexively. A small fire pit smoldered in the corner, coating the wall in soot. 

Functional was the only word that could be applied to the buildings in Hokko.

The rest of the room was dominated by layers of animal furs arranged into a bed. Katsumi sat amongst them, her back propped against the wall. When she saw the bandage in Mamoru's other hand, her eyes narrowed.

"She sent you, didn't she."

"Kats, we've been over this. Hideyo is just trying to help."

"A hawk does not seek help from a _mouse_."

Mamoru sighed as he knelt down beside Katsumi. "How are you feeling?"

"I feel fine. It's been three months. I am ready to leave."

"Hideyo says you need another week or two. Her magic stitched you up, but your body isn't done strengthening the threads. Can I take a look?"

Katsumi nodded and pulled her rough-spun shirt over her head. She wore nothing underneath. Mamoru took a moment to admire her thickly muscled arms, her powerful shoulders. His eyes lingered on her breasts. Katsumi watched him as he looked at her.

He blushed and shifted his gaze to the bandages wrapped around the shapeshifter's midsection. "I, uh... I need to look at the... can I remove the..." He shifted his hands awkwardly, reaching towards the bandages and quickly pulling them away.

Katsumi snorted. "Like a frightened dear every time." She raised her arms over her head.

Mamoru set the new bandage on the furs next to him, careful not to contaminate the thick poultice smeared across it. He moved closer to Katsumi. With delicate fingers he untied the knot on the old binding. His arms wrapped around her waist as he unwound the bandage. Her hands rested on his shoulders as he worked, their faces inches apart. Their breathing quickened.

Mamoru finished removing the bandage. A fist-sized, angry red scar obscured Katsumi's otherwise well-defined abs. Mamoru's fingers rested against scar, still looking into Katsumi's eyes. His hand moved upwards hesitantly, trailing along Katsumi's skin. She pulled him towards her.

Katsumi kissed like she fought. She used her strength to move Mamoru where she wanted, pulling his body onto hers. Mamoru tensed in surprise as she bit his lip. But he quickly adjusted, letting the energy overtake him as well. Mamoru grabbed one of Katsumi's hands resting at the back of his neck and pushed it against the wall behind her. Lost in the moment, his hand moved faster than he expected, slamming her hand into the wall harder than he intended. She winced briefly.

Mamoru pulled back like a man avoiding a blow. "Ah, sorry! I'm still getting used to--."

Katsumi reached out and grabbed him, pulling him back towards her. "Don't insult me with your concern."

But Mamoru pressed a hand against the wall, holding himself back. "No, this is a bad idea. I'm still not used to the strength Tsukuyomi left inside me. I could hurt you." Mamoru pulled himself a way with visible reluctance.

Katsumi growled and brought her hands down in frustration. "I am not as _fragile_ as you think I am."

"I know you're not fragile, Kats. But you _are_ injured. Accepting one doesn't require the other." Mamoru clasped his hands behind his head. "I already did _this_ to you. I'd rather not make it worse." 

There was a long silence as the two regained their composure.

"You want to wait until I am fully recovered. But when that time comes, I will leave."

Mamoru's face fell. "You still want to leave? But the rebellion needs you."

"The rebellion is dead, Mamoru. It died when your friend shot Yoshinobu in the heart." Katsumi looked towards the coals of the fire. "It's time I found my own battles again."

"The rebellion isn't dead. We still have the three of us. And Seiji once he wakes up. We have the army here. Hideyo says more should be coming up from the south soon." Mamoru paused for a moment. "And Chiyoko. I don't know what her plan is, but she has one. That's how she always was, growing up. Three steps ahead of me."

"You are a fool. Chiyoko struck because she was strong and Yoshinobu was weak. That's how the world works."

"That's not how _she_ works."

"Regardless. I did not join the rebellion because these people _needed_ me. I joined to fight. Without Yoshinobu, the army thinks only of defense."

"It won't always be that way, though." Mamoru picked up the new bandage and began to wind it around Katsumi. She did not move to stop him, but neither did she look back from the fire.

"It's been three months and all Hideyo has done is strengthen the walls and build defenses. There is no fire in the soldier's eyes. Only fear and sadness. If I stay here I may as well be a beast in a cage."

"What about us?" Mamoru caught himself and quickly added. "If you leave you'll never get your chance for a rematch, I mean."

"I have said that you may join me."

"You know I can't leave the people here."

"And you know I cannot stay."

Mamoru finished wrapping Katsumi's bandage in silence, unsure what to say. Eventually he finished and the two sat next to each other, their shoulders touching. The mood fell into to a comfortable silence.

After a few minutes, the pair was broken from their reverie by a knock at the door. "Mamoru, sir. Hideyo has asked that you meet her on the walls." One of the soldiers from the rebellion. No one from Hokko would ever call Mamoru sir.

"Can it wait?"

"I don't think so, sir. The rest of our forces just arrived from the south. Most of them are dead."

Mamoru hurried through the village, his breath fogging in the perpetual cold. A soldier had pointed him in the direction of Hideyo and he made his way as directly as he could, picking through the busy village.

Hokko was still littered with piles of rubble from the battle with Tsukuyomi four months ago. But the rebellion soldiers had helped rebuild several of the village's single story, thatched roof buildings. A group of men and women were splitting tree trunks that had been piled at the village center, preparing them to use for further repairs. They discussed the newly arrived soldiers in nervous whispers.

Slender pyramids built from wood dotted the perimeter of Hokko, just inside the inner wall. Each tower had a series of interlocking gears working from the base of the structure up to a large metal sphere covered in holes. Periodically, a small gout of flame would erupt from one of the openings. Mamoru still hadn't convinced Hideyo to explain how her towers maintained their perpetual flame.

Between Hokko's inner and outer wall lay the village's farmlands. Many of the terraced rice paddies had been drained to accommodate the rebellion's forces. For nearly three months, tents and cook fires had sprawled across the various levels of farmland. At roughly two hundred soldiers, the rebellion nearly doubled Hokko's population. Thankfully they brought enough rations to sustain themselves.

When Mamoru reached Hideyo on the inner wall, she was already listening to a beleaguered soldier with a long, black braid down his back. By the bandage on his arm and the ragged condition of his clothing, Mamoru guessed it was a member of the southern forces. 

"--no more than a couple days ahead. Maybe less--." The dark-haired soldier quieted as Mamoru approached.

Hideyo turned and looked over her shoulder. She acknowledged Mamoru with a curt nod and turned back to the soldier. "It's OK, he can hear this too. Go ahead and start from the beginning, if you don't mind."

"Yes, sir. I'm the new leader of the southern detachment. Umako is dead. We were traveling north, escorting the heavier weaponry you had built while you all moved ahead to pursue Tsukuyomi. While we were crossing the mountains we were ambushed. We tried to hold, but we were eventually overrun and forced to abandon the weapons. We've been fleeing north ever since, taking heavy losses. About 80 of us are still alive, of that, probably only 60 are able to fight. The enemy forces are no more than a couple days behind us."

Hideyo's face was stern and hard to read. Since taking over the rebellion, she had become increasingly detached. The timid woman had been scoured away as she fought desperately to protect Yoshinobu's legacy. "80 survivors from an initial force of 300. And armed with our heavy weaponry, no less. This must have been quite the force. Kitsune?"

The man nodded. "Not just the foxes, though. Tengu as well. Plus a couple dragons."

Hideyo's eyes widened slightly. "Ninigi and Amaterasu have joined with Tsukuyomi as well, then. Were any of the three gods present during the fighting?"

"No, sir. But there was a woman who fought alongside them. Before she showed up we thought we had a chance to hold." The man shook his head. "I've never seen anything like what she did. Not even from you and the rest of the commanders. She took out 50 men on her own."

"Did she fight with a bow?" The man nodded. "We're aware of her. Is there anything else?" Hideyo dismissed the man when he shook his head. As he walked away, Hideyo turned to Mamoru, her short form suddenly looked very weary.

"Well, your friend has been busy."

Mamoru's mind was reeling. "There must be some sort of mistake, or something's gone wrong with Chiyoko's plan."

"Mamoru. Chiyoko doesn't have a secret plan. She _betrayed_ us." Hideyo's face twisted in anger, but she quickly let the emotion fade. She held up a hand. "No, it doesn't matter. There's no reason to have this fight again. We've lost."

"What are you talking about? We can't give up now."

"Did you hear him? We were relying on those soldiers and those weapons. And that was just to defend against Tsukuyomi. If there were tengu and dragons attacking, then at least three of the gods have decided to pursue us. And that's not even talking about Chiyoko. You saw what she was capable of when we fought Tsukuyomi. So unless that newfound strength you got from Tsukuyomi's possession is a _lot_ more than you've let on, how exactly do you suggest we get out of this?"

Mamoru stared at Hideyo, unable to find an answer.

The woman shrugged. "The best we can do is get the villagers out of here. If we can dig in and hold on long enough, we might be able to give you a big enough head start to get away. You'll have to leave immediately. I'll have the soldiers round up enough rations for all of you. We won't be needing them much longer."

"I'm not leaving you here to die Hideyo. We all go together or we all stand and fight."

"Mamoru, there's no reason everyone has to die. The gods are going to pursue the rebellion no matter what. But what do they care about your village? You could save them. You could save Katsumi."
