Moto raced towards the wall, jockeying for position amongst the other students. No one wanted to be last. As usual, Keta was first.

The long-limbed shapeling ran ahead of the pack with steam trailing off his body like a cape flapping in the wind. He reached the base of the wall 20 feet ahead of the others, moving with a speed even the other flame-eaters couldn't match. He tensed his legs and jumped nearly twenty feet in the air. Keta planted his foot and pushed off again, continuing upwards.

The momentum from his push brought him away from the wall, but Keta snapped his arm forward, letting the bright yellow silks wrapped around his wrist shoot towards a post at the top of the wall. The silk wrapped tight and Keta used the anchor to hurl himself over the wall. Just like that, he was out of sight.

Moto shouldered another student out of the way and reached for his bond with the mountain. A peculiar sense of weight entered his hands, tugging on everything around him. Moto focused the energy forwards, pulling on the wall. His body lurched forwards, the added speed giving him some breathing room from the rest of the pack. He reached the wall and jumped.

Unlike Keta, Moto jumped a normal human amount. As he approached the wall, Moto brought his knees to his chest, focusing gravity into his legs. He landed feet first and began running up the vertical stone.

The movement was awkward. To keep himself from falling, he had to pull hard against the wall, which made it hard to lift his feet. The weight of his upper body pulled him backwards. Several kids passed him, shooting jets of flame behind to propel them. Moto saw Fumi clear the wall in a single gust-powered leap.

Moto cursed under his breath. He pulled on the top of the wall with his hands. At this distance the force was weak, but it was enough to lessen the downward pressure and allow him to move at a jog rather than a walk. He crested the top of the wall in time to see the wave of students who had passed him as they approached the next obstacle.

A 50 foot wide ravine had been carved into the landscape of the Playground. Moto was still amazed at how quickly the master Daggers could reshape the landscape of the main training facility. He knew the stone had been chosen carefully for its ease of shaping, but still. Yesterday there had been a small hill there.

Moto jumped from the wall at the same time as a couple of flame-eaters. The heat energy they pulled into their bodies supercharged their muscles, letting them take the heavy landing in stride. Whatever minor damage their muscles took, it would heal quickly thanks to their enhanced metabolisms. Moto, had to settle for pulling against the top of the wall to slow his descent. 

By the time he reached the ground, Moto was only ahead of three students: two stone-eaters and the lone flood-bringer. Their powers were particularly ill-suited for the obstacle course. Moto charged forward, determined to beat more than just the stragglers.

He came to the edge of the ravine and looked down. It was deep, filled with large wooden beams jutting out of the walls and floor at random angles. The chasm was too wide to leap, even for wind-bringers like Fumi who could summon gusts of wind to propel her. She was midway through the cavern leaping from beam to beam. 

Moto scanned the area beneath him, plotting the fastest route to the other side. He took a step backwards and took a running leap into the ravine, using his ability to pull on a wooden beam further than he could otherwise reach. Moto collided with the pillar, gripping tightly. Now that his momentum was gone, he had to rely almost entirely on his power. It was slow going. Thankfully, it seemed like most of the students were facing similar problems.

Moto managed to gain some ground on a couple of the fire-bringers. The flames they shot might offer some small speed boost, but they were nothing like the propulsion of Fumi's wind. Moto pulled himself over the opposite ledge of the ravine and sprinted into the woods on the other side.

As he moved through the trees, Moto realized the tight pack of trees was ideal for his ability. He could run directly towards a trunk, pulling on it to gain speed. At the last moment he would step to the side, pulling against a tree to the side if he needed.

At the speed he was traveling, Moto almost didn't have time to react to the large bear that came leaping at him from the thick undergrowth. He pulled desperately against a nearby tree trunk, barely managing to pull himself out of range of the creature's claws. Moto caught his foot in a tree root, sending him sprawling to the ground. At the speed he was moving, he hit the ground hard skinning his right elbow and knee.

Moto slid to a stop just a few feet from a river that ran through the forest. He pulled himself to his feet, groaning and cradling his now bleeding arm. The bear charged, forcing Moto to flee. He pulled on the trees carefully this time, fast enough to outpace the bear, but still keeping a more manageable pace.

Moto came bursting from the forest, hoping to make up time on the next obstacle. He came up short as he saw several students standing in a group ahead of him. They were gathered around Iruka, was waiting for everyone to emerge from the woods. Behind him was a series of multi-story wooden buildings with steeply angled roofs still under construction.

Iruka noticed Moto and gestured. "That's enough for now. The rest of the course is under construction."

Moto blinked, the tension leaving him abruptly at the unexpected end to the competition. He counted the students standing around Iruka. Five. He'd only managed to pass one person after climbing the wall. He clenched his fists as he approached the group, his head hanging.
