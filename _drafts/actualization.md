# Training
Moto raced towards the wall, jockeying for position amongst the other students. No one wanted to be last. As usual, Keta was first.

The long-limbed shapeling ran ahead of the pack with steam trailing off his body like a cape flapping in the wind. He reached the base of the wall 20 feet ahead of the others, moving with a speed even the other flame-eaters couldn't match. He tensed his legs and jumped nearly twenty feet in the air. Keta planted his foot and pushed off again, continuing upwards.

The momentum from his push brought him away from the wall, but Keta snapped his arm forward, letting the bright yellow silks wrapped around his wrist shoot towards a post at the top of the wall. The silk wrapped tight and Keta used the anchor to hurl himself over. Just like that, he was out of sight.

Moto shouldered another student out of the way and reached for his bond with the mountain. A peculiar sense of weight entered his hands, tugging on everything around him. Moto focused the energy in front of him, pulling on the wall. His body lurched forwards, the added speed giving him some breathing room from the rest of the pack. He reached the wall and jumped.

Unlike Keta, Moto jumped a normal human amount. As he approached the wall, Moto brought his knees to his chest, focusing gravity into his legs. He landed feet first and began running up the vertical stone.

The movement was awkward. To keep himself from falling, he had to pull hard against the wall, which made it difficult to lift his feet. The weight of his upper body pulled him backwards. Several kids passed him, shooting jets of flame behind to propel them. Moto saw Fumi clear the wall in a single gust-powered leap.

Moto cursed under his breath and pulled on the top of the wall. At this distance the force was weak, but it was enough to lessen the downward pressure and allow him to move at a jog rather than a walk. He crested the top of the wall in time to see the wave of students who had passed him as they approached the next obstacle.

A 50 foot wide ravine had been carved into the landscape of the Playground. Moto was still amazed at how quickly the master Daggers could reshape the landscape of the main training facility. He knew the stone had been chosen carefully for its ease of shaping, but still. Yesterday there had been a small hill there.

Moto jumped from the wall at the same time as a couple of flame-eaters. The heat energy they pulled into their bodies supercharged their muscles, letting them take the heavy landing in stride. Whatever minor damage their muscles took, it would heal quickly thanks to their enhanced metabolisms. Moto had to settle for pulling against the top of the wall to slow his descent. 

By the time he reached the ground, Moto was only ahead of three students: two stone-eaters and the lone flood-bringer. Their powers were particularly ill-suited for the obstacle course. Moto charged forward, determined to beat more than just the losers.

He came to the edge of the ravine and looked down. It was deep, filled with large wooden beams jutting out of the walls and floor at random angles. The chasm was too wide to leap, even for wind-bringers like Fumi who could summon gusts of wind to propel her. She was midway through the cavern jumping from beam to beam. 

Moto scanned the area beneath him, plotting the fastest route to the other side. He could get a running start for his first jump, but after that he would have to rely almost entirely on his power. It would be slow going. Thankfully, it seemed like most of the students were facing similar problems.

He took a step backwards and took a running leap into the ravine, using his ability to pull on a wooden pillar further than he could otherwise reach. Moto collided, gripping tightly. He felt stupid, limbs wrapped around the beam as he shuffled to the other side of the pole in order could continue forward.

Moto managed to gain some ground on a couple of the fire-bringers. The flames they shot might offer a small speed boost, but they were nothing like the propulsion of Fumi's wind. 

Moto pulled himself over the opposite ledge of the ravine and sprinted into the woods on the other side. As he moved through the forest, he could run directly towards a trunk, pulling on it to gain speed. At the last moment he would step to the side, and begin the process with a new tree further ahead. The tight forest was ideal for his ability. He whipped past a couple of the other kids.

At the speed he was traveling, Moto almost didn't have time to react to the large bear that came leaping at him from the thick undergrowth. He pulled desperately against a nearby tree trunk, barely managing to pull himself out of range of the creature's claws. Moto caught his foot in a tree root, sending him sprawling to the ground. He hit the ground hard, skinning his right elbow and knee.

Moto slid to a stop just a few feet from a river that ran through the forest. He pulled himself to his feet, groaning and cradling his now bleeding arm. The bear charged, forcing Moto to flee. He pulled on the trees carefully this time, fast enough to outpace the bear, but keeping a more manageable pace.

Moto came bursting from the forest, hoping to make up time on the next obstacle. He came up short as he saw several students standing in a group ahead of him. They were gathered around Iruka, who was waiting for everyone to emerge from the woods. Behind her was a series of multi-story wooden buildings with steeply angled roofs still under construction.

Iruka noticed Moto and gestured. "That's enough for now. The rest of the course is under construction."

Moto blinked, the tension leaving him abruptly at the unexpected end to the competition. He counted the students standing around Iruka. Five. He'd only managed to pass one person after climbing the wall. He clenched his fists as he approached the group, his head hanging.

Fumi was talking with Keta, her long hair flying wildly as she gestured. She dropped into a crouch, then stood abruptly, shooting her hands above her head. A gust of wind spiraled around her, ruffling the clothes of everyone in the group.

"Whoops! Sorry." Fumi turned back towards Keta, jumping around with more reservation. Keta just stood with arms crossed, smiling warmly. He said listening to Fumi's stories was like watching a play put on by children. Moto was pretty sure he meant it as a complement. 

Moto felt a flash of jealousy watching Fumi bounce around without a care. Wind was the most flexible resonance, useful in almost every situation. Fumi didn't appreciate at all how lucky she was. She had probably never stopped to think about what it would be like to get a weaker resonance. She took it as a given that things would just work out in her favor.

Keta noticed Moto and raised a hand, motioning him to join. As soon as she saw him approaching, Fumi's gestures ceased. "Hey." She gave a small wave with her hand.

"Hey." Moto looked towards the buildings under construction behind Iruka.

Keta looked between them and shook his head. He placed a hand on Moto's shoulder and pulled him closer, rubbing his back for a moment. Keta looked down at the blood along Moto's arm and tsk'ed. "Always you come away bleeding. You know that is not a requirement of practice, yes?"

Moto waved a hand. "It's fine, I just tripped and skinned my elbow. What were you two talking about?"

Keta nodded towards Fumi. "This one was just telling me how she planned to beat me when we run the full course."

Fumi took the bait eagerly. "I _will_ beat you! I was just sloppy on the first obstacle. And I've got some ideas for new tricks." She smiled wickedly. 

"I can't wait to see them. Assuming, of course, that I haven't already finished the race by the time you use them. Like today." They were both smiling. Fumi seemed to enjoy the challenge posed by Keta's seeming invincibility. Keta just liked teasing.

"You just wait." Fumi and Keta clapped hands and then she walked away. She didn't bother saying bye to Moto.

Moto extricated himself from Keta's arm, turning so he could look at the shapeling while they talked. Keta wore tight black clothes emblazoned with his house, just like the rest of the students. He had protested for the first few days, insisting on wearing his vibrant red dancer's clothes. Eventually he had relented to the pressure from the master Daggers, but he still wore the bright yellow silks around his wrists in rebellion.

"I don't know why you insist on calling me over when you're talking to her."

"Ah, you two will be friends, I know it. Besides, I do not want to waste my time telling the same stories and hearing the same jokes twice talking to each of you separately. Things are boring enough with this endless practicing."

"Some of us actually need the practice, you know."

Before Keta could respond, the remaining students joined the group at last and Iruka called everyone together.

"This course is going to be our focus for the next couple weeks." The two stone-eaters and the flood-bringer, the students who had come in last, all groaned.

One of the stone-eaters spoke up. "But shouldn't we be practicing things that suit our resonance? I'm going to be a fighter, not an infiltrator."

Iruka sighed audibly. Moto still didn't understand why the woman volunteered to train the new recruits. Maybe it was some sort of punishment.

"Where exactly do you think you'll be fighting? Outside the castle walls? You're going to go challenge all your targets to duels then and hope they show up?"

The boy who asked the question melted back into the crowd a bit, his face red.

"Motion is the basis for _all_ Daggers. There are plenty of Tournament Heroes and Villains who have similar powers to you. But the ability to apply those powers in unexpected places, unnoticed, and in unpredictable ways is what makes you different. Every one of your powers will change and improve the way you move through the world. This course will help you find the pattern that works with your ability.

"I want you all to spend the rest of the day practicing on your own. Starting tomorrow, you can ask me or your house for advice. But it's also important that you get in the habit of analyzing your abilities and identifying ways to improve on your own. Sometimes circumstances will change in the middle of a mission and you'll have to adapt.

"I will give you one thought to focus your initial explorations. What is the difference between Eaters and Bringers?"

<br />

Moto hit the ground with a dull thud. He slammed his fists in the dirt, cursing loudly. The wall loomed above him, mocking his attempts.

"How did climbing a wall feel _harder_ after I learned to control gravity."

Moto pulled against the wall with his power, bringing himself to his feet. He'd lost count of how many times he had brushed the dirt from his back. He walked away from the wall, his movements stiff, steeling himself for another attempt. He was alone. The other kids had gone back to their houses to ask for advice or moved on to other obstacles. It didn't matter.

Moto didn't feel like he had much progress to show for the last two days. He needed to work harder. 

Moto knelt down, placing his hands on either side of his front foot. He sprinted towards the wall again. 

As he pumped his arms, he reached out and grabbed the earth in front of him, pulling himself forward by invisible ropes of force. Each stride was twice as long as normal. When he reached the wall, he focused gravity into his feet, giving him traction. He kept pulling on the wall above.

What was the difference between Eaters and Bringers? On the surface, the answer was simple. Eaters could pull power into their body. Bringers could manifest the energy in the world around them. But Moto knew there was more to the question.

Eaters were durable. The energy they focused into their bodies allowed them to create and withstand massive forces. Keta could leap 20 feet in the air. The stone-eaters could drop from the wall without slowing their descent, hardening their legs to the impact. 

Bringers were fragile. Their bodies still broke normally. So they had to apply a smaller, more constant force. If Moto was careful to always be pulling against the ground in front of him, he could reach the same speed as Keta. If he could get the timing right he could clear the wall just as quickly. 

On the first run, he'd used too much gravity at once, trying to stick his feet to the wall completely. It was better to hit the barrier at high speed, using gravity to give him just enough traction as he continued upwards. 

Moto bounded up the wall easily, all awkwardness gone from his stride. He was getting better at the constant pulling. As he neared the top of the wall he pulled behind himself, slowing his run so that he would come to rest on top of the wall. He increased the gravity in his feet, compensating for the decreased momentum. This was it, he could feel it.

Moto's foot slipped. He hadn't compensated enough with the gravity in his feet. His hand slapped the smooth surface of the wall, just a few inches below the ledge. It was amazing how much he had grown to hate that ledge.

Moto pulled against the wall to slow his descent, but he let himself drop the last few feet onto his back, feeling his own inadequacy. Why had he gotten such a difficult resonance to use?

Moto forced the hopeless thoughts out of his mind. He pushed himself upright. Even if he got the hardest resonance, he'd find a way. He hadn't gotten handouts in the last three years and he didn't need any now either. Moto allowed himself one last hateful glance at the top of the wall, mentally taking a sledgehammer to it.

As he looked, Iruka's head appeared over the ledge. "You're wasting your time practicing here."

"I'm making progress." Moto turned and began walking away from the wall.

"Oh yeah, the dirt all over your butt really screams progress." Iruka jumped off the wall, one hand trailing above her. Her fall slowed at the last minute, allowing her to land easily. She was a stone-bringer like Moto. "Why haven't you asked for any advice?"

"I don't want advice. I need to figure it out on my own."

"Well, as much as I admire your dedication to not wasting my time, I _do_ have to stay here until you all finish practicing for the day. So maybe I could offer a tip just to speed things up?"

"I don't _need_ a tip. I already figured out your question before. The difference between Eaters and Bringers is durability. I need to apply my ability in smaller amounts more frequently. It's just taking time to master."

Iruka pulled on a tuft of her spiky black hair thoughtfully, head cocked to the side. "Huh, I guess that's one way you could have taken the question. It's true enough I suppose. It's the wrong answer, though."

"What do you mean? I've clearly gotten better using that answer."

"You've gotten better at copying Keta, you mean."

"He's the best, shouldn't that be my goal?"

Iruka shook her head. "You're too focused on the areas where you think others are stronger than you. If you just try to copy Keta, he'll always have an advantage over you. You have to take a different path. Here, I'll show you."

Iruka walked around the wall, not bothering to check if Moto followed. Moto considered ignoring the woman and continuing with his current training. But maybe his back could use a few minutes break from absorbing his falls.

When they reached the other side of the wall, Iruka stopped and pointed out Fumi, who was standing a few feet back from the edge of the ravine filled with wooden beams. She had a look of concentration on her face, smiling slightly.

Moto watched as she took a running leap into the pit, blasting air behind her. She managed to travel about a fourth of the way across the chasm before she grabbed on to one of the poles. Her jump had been a little off course, though. Instead of landing square against the pillar, she was forced to reach out with one arm, just barely hooking around it. 

The awkward catch sent her swinging around the pole. But instead of waiting for her momentum to stop, Fumi threw her free hand behind her and shot another blast of wind. The force sent her rocketing around the pole. She let go at the height of the spin and went launching into the air. She didn't have much control over the move yet, but she was able to latch onto a beam almost three quarters of the way across the chasm. It was twice as far as her initial jump.

Iruka laughed at Moto's dumbfounded expression. "Running up that wall for two days straight feels pretty dumb, doesn't it? You see it, now. The difference between Eaters and Bringers. For Eaters, the power comes before they move. For Bringers, the power comes _while_ they move." Iruka walked away, waving over her shoulder. "I think you can figure out the rest."

<br />

<br />

Moto stood in the cavernous stone entry chamber to Terran House tying off a cloth satchel filled with his dinner. 

The chamber was carved from the stone of the mountain, an echoing cave-like structure large enough that it could have held several normal buildings. Originally, the entry chamber had been completely smooth, but over the years stalactites and stalagmites had begun to form, helped along by stone-bringer residents who thought they added a nice cave-like vibe to their home. There were numerous pathways eroded into the floor, weaving around the more precarious stone spikes, detouring towards some of the artistically painted walls, and eventually plunging into the ant-hill of subterranean tunnels that led to the rest of Terran.

Moto threw the sack over his shoulder and made for the exit. The other kids of Terran didn't interest him much, so he usually bundled his food and took it to the Playground so he could eat with Keta. Tonight, though, he had another destination in mind. 

He'd made a lot of headway in the last week of practice. It took a while to adapt the ideas from Fumi's air spin into something that felt right for his own ability, but he was satisfied with the result. Satisfied enough that he felt OK taking a break from training to pursue another goal.

Moto emerged from Terran and immediately cursed, shielding his face as the setting sun stabbed daggers into his eyes. The rugged peaks of Iga were quite beautiful. Many features of the village, like Terran's west-facing exit, had been created to heighten the experience of the mountain. Moto still thought they were a little _too_ caught up in the aesthetic.

Eventually, his eyes adjusted enough that he could lower his hand, though they still watered as he looked down the rock face. The metal mining cart that he usually took to the Playground was immediately to his right. In front of him was a steep, switchbacked trail leading down the mountain. The other three houses were isolated, but Terran was situated within the largest source of stone in Iga, which meant it shared its squat, bulky peak with the main village below. 

The village was huddled in the crook of several upthrust spears of stone. The rock formations blocked the wind and hid the massive drop into clouds on all sides. The village was where those who supported the normal functions of the village lived, so it was made to feel more welcoming.

Moto set off down the trail. He let his body lean forward precariously, pulling on the stone behind to steady himself. Occasionally, his focus would slip and he would stumble forward, coming alarmingly close to the edges of the trail. But Moto pushed himself to use his ability constantly. He wanted it to be as easy as breathing. 

Besides, it made every hill feel like a flat surface, which was a huge advantage amidst a village of mountain-crazed architects.

Moto made it to the base of the mountain and passed between the modest wooden buildings of the village, watching as shop keepers stood on ladders, lighting paper lanterns for the evening. Many of the lanterns were painted with a many-tailed fox, ready to pounce. The image was repeated in stone statues all over Iga, paying tribute to Tsukuyomi. The Champion who protected Iga was aligned with the fox god.

At the edge of the buildings, Moto walked along the raised walkways that passed between the public gardens. At this altitude, Iga imported most of it's food from Koga below, but the village made sure to produce enough to last a while on its own, just in case.

On the other side of the gardens, the Gearhouse stood pressed against one of the stone outcroppings that surrounded the village. The building was nearly as big as the Playground, six stories tall and as wide as three houses from the village behind Moto. From this side, the building looked dull. It's unadorned square lines and small windows hiding the chaos that rang within. The Gearhouse was where they maintained the mechanisms that powered the steel carts connecting the spires of Iga. It was also where new weapons were invented and tested.

The opposite side of the Gearhouse, which protruded from the other side of the rock outcropping, was a web of steel railways and open-air rooms for testing projectiles and explosives. Not all of the rooms were open-air by design.

Moto entered the building and approached the railcart hub. The Gearhouse had a connection to every spire in Iga, which often made it the fastest way to get around.

A short, young woman with bright red hair and ruby-colored eyes sat at the barrier in front of the railcart tracks, drumming her fingers against the railing and looking into the distance absently. She didn't notice Moto as he approached. A notebook lay open in her lap. From his angle, Moto could only make out a series of figures and numbers scrawled haphazardly across the page. Moto tapped the woman's shoulder.

The woman yelped in surprise, throwing her notebook into the air as she leapt from her seat and spun towards Moto. Moto managed to pull the notebook through the air and into his hand before if crashed to the ground.

The woman stood with her hand on her chest, breathing heavily as she looked up at Moto. "Mother's Scales, what's _wrong_ with you? You can't say something a few feet away like a normal person? You scared me half to death!" The woman gasped and looked around the ground frantically. "My notebook! Have you seen--"

Moto held the book out to her, still too caught off guard by her reaction to say anything. The woman snatched the book from his hands and sat back on the stool in a huff. She looked at his tight-fitting black clothes.

"All you Daggers are so creepy, moving around without making a sound. Well? Don't you have anything to say for yourself?"

"I'm uh-- I'm sorry? I thought you could see me. I walked straight towards you."

"Apology accepted. Now, what can I do for you? I'm a little busy, in case you hadn't noticed." The woman waved her notebook in front of Moto.

"I wanted to take a cart to the Contract House. Could you bring one over?"

The woman eyed Moto. "Why would a youngling like you have business at the Bloodhall?"

Moto bristled. The woman only seemed to be a few years older than him. "Why would a glimmer like you be manning the railcarts?"

Most of the mechanical work and weapons research in Iga was overseen by glimmers. The race's supernatural affinity for crystals and metallic alloys gave them an innate proficiency with tinkering. Most made new tools and technologies for society. The less scrupulous ones invented weapons for Iga. Almost none operated railway carts.

"Hah! Fair enough. I'm on probation." She bore the fact like a badge of pride.

"What for?" Moto hoped she would forget her earlier question.

The woman rolled her eyes toward the ceiling, tilting her head to the side and imitating a high, nasally voice. "_Unauthorized demolitions work._" She threw a hand in the air. "Like no one has ever blown a hole in the building before. I mean _look_ at the cliffside wall." 

She did have a point.

"You're a demolitionist then?" It made sense, the woman's red hair and eyes meant she was a gemstone glimmer. She would specialize in infusing gems with energy to be discharged at a later date. And rubies held fire.

The woman sniffed. "No, I'm an _artist_."

Moto sighed, smiling despite himself. "I think I have a friend you would like talking to."

"Oh? And are they the chunin-ranked individual waiting for you at the Bloodhall?" She looked at him knowingly. Damn. So much for distracting her.

Moto rubbed the back of his head. "Iruka told our class that the top four finishers in the obstacle course next week earn the right to join him on a D-rank contract. I was just curious to look at the contracts and see what some of them might be."

It was a lie. He wanted unsupervised time amongst the records. He was very curious to know who had funded a specific contract from three years ago.

The woman sat silently, having none of it.

"Alright, alright. I was going to try and sneak into the jonin training area." Moto looked at the ground guiltily. "I wanted to use the cooler weapons."

The woman nodded. It hadn't taken much time living on his own for Moto to learn that the best way to lie was to let the other person catch you in a smaller one first.

"You know no genin are allowed at the Contract House without an escort who's chunin or higher. If you got caught, _especially_ if you got caught in the jonin area, I'd be stuck here for weeks!"

Moto looked up from the ground, doing his best to sound conspiratorial. "You could come along too! That way you could keep an eye on me." Moto took a leap based on the story she'd told earlier. It didn't sound like she was very senior, so she probably didn't get much time with the more powerful explosives. "Plus you could try out some of the higher grade explosives yourself!"

The woman looked tempted for a minute, but eventually thought better of it. She waved her hands in front of her as though she was physically batting away the rebellious thoughts. "I'm in too much trouble already. Sorry, friend."

Moto sighed theatrically. "Ah, you're probably right anyways." He slumped down on the stool next to the woman.

He knew it wasn't likely he'd be able to stroll into the Contract House on his first attempt. If he won the obstacle course next week, maybe he'd have a chance to slip away when Iruka took them to choose their first mission. At the very least he'd have a chance to scout the building a bit. He could wait.

Moto turned his attention to the real reason he had come. 

"Well, so much for a night of adventure. Do you mind if I eat my dinner here?" He pulled open the satchel of food.

"Doesn't bother me."

Moto sat and pulled apart a loaf of bread, eating it quietly as the woman returned to the figures in her notebook. He waited a moment, then leaned over her shoulder. "What're you working on?"

She waved a hand distractedly. "You probably wouldn't find it that interesting."

Moto slid his stool a bit closer, trying to sound curious. "No, try me! It looks cool."

The woman turned to look at him. "You really wanna know?" Moto nodded. "Well, how much do you know about the discharge rates of the resonant gems?"

Moto shook his head. "Not much. But hopefully I'll know more by the end of the night." He smiled.

"Hah. Sure, why not? I wasn't going to get much work done without my tools anyways." She closed her notebook and set it on her lap. "It'll be nice to have some company. Let's start with the basics..."

While the glimmer woman talked, Moto sliced off a piece of warm taro root and offered it to her. She paused to eat it gratefully. "My name's Moto, by the way."

She spoke through a mouthful of food. "Nice to meet you Moto. I'm Seiko."

He might not be able to get in tonight, but it didn't hurt to make friends with the person who held the keys.

<br />

It was strange to see the Playground filled with people who weren't training. The lower walkways lining the walls of the building were filled with people who came to watch the new recruits run the obstacle course. Apparently, this was the point when more senior Daggers started to pay attention, looking for promising candidates to recruit onto their squads.

There were even some regular individuals from the town, sitting in small clusters along the railings. They carried small boxes full of snacks and chatted happily. While the crowd was mostly Daggers, the villagers contributed almost all of the festival-like atmosphere.

The 13 new Dagger recruits milled about in the grass around the starting line. Moto could tell he wasn't the only one who was unsettled by the cheery ambiance. The kids were quiet, stealing furtive glances towards the walls of spectators before looking back to the ground. For a bunch of loners, training in the secret arts of stealth and assassination, the biggest challenge for all of them today was probably the happy, smiling parents bouncing babies on their knee and pointing in the recruits' direction.

Well, it was probably the biggest challenge for everyone except two of the recruits.

Moto honestly couldn't tell who was working the crowd more, Fumi or Keta. Fumi was, as always, loud and brash. She threw herself into the air on blasts of wind, flipping and twisting, then striking dramatic poses. She seemed especially fond of landing in a crouch, head down, one hand pressed against the ground, the other thrust out behind her. She held the position for effect, breathing heavily. Then she spun rapidly, gripping a handful of grass and blasting it at the crowd. Her antics had earned her a boisterous crowd of fans among the villagers, cheering and clapping appreciatively after every move. 

Keta's routine was more polished. He stretched his body into incredible poses or walked about on his hands. At one point during a handstand, he lifted one hand to the side, so that his weight was supported by a single arm. He raised onto his fingertips, then curled his pinky and ring fingers in to his palm so that he only held himself with three fingers. Moto lost count of how many pushups he did in this pose. 

Whereas Fumi turned to the crowd after each stunt, hyping up their applause, Keta hardly spared them a glance. But it was clear that he positioned himself to be seen, and he waved warmly at any of the children who called out to him. His audience seemed to be caught in a state of quiet awe. Moto was also amused to see that it was mostly starry-eyed young women.

Moto approached Keta and crossed his arms, smiling. "Having fun showing off?"

The shapeling dropped from his handstand, knocking dirt from his hands. His cheeks were flushed with excitement. "I am not showing off, I am _performing_. This audience has taken from their day to come see us. These are precious moments that they will never get back. It is a wonderful gift. And it is our duty to make these moments memorable."

"I don't think you have many allies in that opinion." Moto looked over his shoulder at the other recruits, all of whom seemed to be in progressive stages of mental breakdown. They'd all snap together once the contest started, but it was cute seeing them so nervous.

Moto caught himself. These were kids training to be killers. Some day they might descend on a festival like this, blades slick with blood.

Keta noticed Moto's frown. "What are you thinking?"

"Nothing, just running through the course in my mind again."

Keta smiled. "Always so serious, living in your head instead of your body."

"Keta, why do you want to be a Dagger? You seem to love performing. Why willingly adopt a life in the shadows?"

Moto saw Iruka drop from one of the walkways along the wall and move towards the recruits. It was almost time to start. Keta grabbed Moto's hand and started walking to the start line. Moto was amused to see several girls' faces fall.

"I love my family. And my dance troupe. And our performances. I miss them all, it is true. But we spent our entire lives moving between a tiny set of towns. It was too dangerous to journey any further.

"For most of us, this was not a problem. It is simply how the world works. But my mother has always wanted more. She yearns to see the world. To share our dancing with all the people of Yosai. You can see the fire in her eyes when she talks about it.

"I joined the Daggers so that I could make the world a safer place. I hope that some day my mother can travel freely across Yosai. After everything she has given me in life, it seems that giving up the stage is a small enough sacrifice."

Moto was silent for a moment, just appreciating the feel of Keta's fingers laced between his own. For the first time, he worried what Iga might do to Keta's worldview. "But not every contract is going to be about making the countryside safer."

"I will not take those contracts." Keta spoke matter-of-factly. As though it really would be that simple.

Moto didn't bother arguing. Now wasn't the time. And he knew the odds of changing Keta's mind on just about anything.

By the time the two reached the starting line, most of the other recruits were already in place, focusing ahead. Fumi was walking backwards, waving and bowing to her fans.

Keta squeezed Moto's hand one last time before letting go. "Besides, it is not like I have lost all opportunities to perform. I will have fun today, I think." He flashed a mischievous grin. 

Everyone was in place now. Iruka walked to the front of the group and spoke quietly. "Alright, you all know the bulk of what's going on, so I won't waste anyone's time repeating it. There's only two things that are different from what you've been practicing the last few weeks. One, the finish line is no longer outside the woods. The towers were finished last night, and the new finish line is on their rooftops.

"The buildings are filled with coins similar to the entrance exam. You need one to finish, which means you can't just jump to the top of the buildings and be done, you'll have to go inside. Now, the second change is-- oh, for crying out-- _what?_"

Moto looked to his left and saw a familiar young boy holding his hand up, an earnest look on his face. He was on the younger side of the recruits, 15 years old at most. He had long hair tied back in a ponytail and circular glasses. Moto had to strain for a moment to remember his name. Hako. Man, that kid faded into the background.

Hako winced at Iruka's outburst, but pushed on. "Are there enough coins for everyone? And can we collect more than one coin?"

They were actually pretty good questions. Somehow, this seemed to bother Iruka more.

"Yes there are enough coins for everyone. And no, you can't take more than one coin. This time everyone is meant to finish. OK, moving on. The second difference is that you all can interfere with each other this time." Iruka looked up at the audience along the walls. "Attacks should be meant to slow your opponents down, not hurt or disable them. If we see any of you attacking too aggressively, you'll be disqualified.

"Any questions?" Iruka looked to Hako with trepidation. The boy stared back earnestly.

Moto considered the new rules. He had known the buildings would eventually be a part of the course, so he'd thought about how he could use his powers in that setting. The ability to attack other recruits was unexpected though. Moto could see a ripple through everyone as they processed that information. It changed the nature of the contest significantly.

Taking an early lead would be dangerous now, making you a target for everyone behind. Moto glanced at Keta, wondering what the shapeling would do. He stood calmly, smiling confidently as always. He'd be fine.

But what should Moto do? Pulling ahead seemed risky, but so did getting caught up in the pack, where attacks could come from all sides. Getting hit by someone's attack would probably be a huge setback, more than slipping on the wall or traversing the pit inefficiently. Avoiding others would be the top priority.

Should he run to the side? Moto felt a moment of frustration. He'd spent the last several weeks perfecting a run through the course, but this change turned everything on its head. That was probably the point, though. They wanted to see how the kids adapted. It didn't make it any less annoying though.

Iruka smiled at everyone's uncertainty at the new rules. Seeing no questions, she turned and walked out of everyone's way. The crowd along the walls grew silent in anticipation, tension permeating the air. Iruka raised her arm. Then let it fall.

There was a surge of motion as all the recruits shot forward. They shouldered one another, trying to make space for themselves. A few kids were knocked aside by a burst of wind as Fumi launched herself ahead of the pack, taking the lead.

Moto didn't move, waiting for the other kids to push forward. His ability relied on momentum. He couldn't afford to get hit by others. So he waited for the field to clear a bit.

He was surprised to see two other individuals standing at the starting line as well. Hako was there, which made sense. But so was Keta. Moto gave him a questioning look. "I would not have expected caution from you..."

Most of the kids had reached the base of the wall now. Moto was surprised to see the stone-eaters faring better than most. They had originally seemed poorly suited to the contest. But now, their ability to increase their weight and harden their bodies was proving a valuable tool for ignoring the attacks of others. Moto watched as one of them leaned into a shove from another recruit, then reach out and clubbed them off the wall with a heavy fist.

Fumi had managed to avoid most of the conflict, reaching the top of the wall unscathed.

Keta turned to him, smiling. "Caution? No, friend. Showmanship." He dropped into a crouch and threw his arms back. The muscles on his body flared as a massive gout of steam came hissing off his body. Moto felt a surge of heat hit him, forcing him to take a step back. He gasped as Keta launched himself forward.

Keta was obviously the most skilled amongst the new recruits. He won every competition set before them. He did so with an effortless grace. Moto thought it was because he had more experience with his resonance than everyone else. Maybe that was true. But watching Keta really _try_, Moto become much less certain it was so simple.

Keta cleared the 20 feet from the starting line to the wall in a single jump. He flipped in the air, landing with his feet against the wall, perpendicular to the ground. The stone cracked beneath the weight of the impact. Keta pivoted on the wall, sliding his feet along its surface and spinning. He flung his arms out and knocked two kids off the wall with the weighted silks that dangled from his wrists.

His forward momentum gone, Keta began to fall back towards the ground. He landed in a roll, spinning back to face the wall. He took three long strides parallel to the wall and jumped, landing with both feet against the shoulders of a stone-eater. Keta kicked off in a backflip. Even with the stone-eater's increased weight, he slid several feet down the wall from the force of Keta's push.

Tumbling through the air, Keta lashed out with his silks again and snagged the ankle of a girl nearing the top of the wall. He used her as an anchor to swing himself towards the top of the wall. The motion sent the unsuspecting girl toppling backwards. 

Keta landed on top of the wall lightly. He turned towards the largest wall of onlookers and bowed, then dropped off the other side to a thunder of applause.

Moto watched with a mix of pride and jealousy, seeing just how large the gap was.

The girl had taken a couple other kids down with her fall. The stone-eater had been pushed several feet to the side. And the two recruits who Keta first knocked off the wall were still picking themselves up, recovering from their surprise. At this point, the wall was fairly clear. 

Moto pushed aside his feelings of envy. Jealous or not, Keta's ascent had helped him. It had cleared out the wall sooner than Moto expected, meaning he wouldn't have to wait as long to get started. 

Besides, there was only one way he would catch up to Keta's skill. Time to act.

Moto took off at an angle to the wall. As he ran, he pulled on the ground to his left, sending him into a wide arc towards the wall. As he ran, he felt the weight of the acceleration, like his insides had all shifted to the right inside him. His stride lengthened as his speed increased. 

Instead of meeting the wall head on, Moto reached the base of the wall traveling almost parallel, moving in the opposite direction from where he started. He jumped, releasing his current anchor and latching on to a point high up on the wall. He let his feet become heavy, gaining traction along the surface of the wall.

An eater's power came before they moved. They traveled in straight lines, facing things head on. But a bringer had control _while_ they moved. Early on, Moto had been running at the wall directly, working against gravity the whole way up the barrier. But now he ran along it's surface in a semicircle, letting his speed build before he moved directly upwards.

Moto grabbed onto the same boy that Keta had flipped off of, using him as an anchor to change directions. The stone-eater cursed, straining against Moto's momentum. Poor kid, used as a stepping stone twice. Should have thought more before rushing towards the wall.

Moto was moving fast now. Almost too fast to process. He shot over the top of the wall clearing it by a good ten feet. He pulled against the top of the wall hard, slowing his momentum as he arced over the barrier.

Landing was the tricky part. He could get himself moving incredibly fast, but he needed to be able to survive the landing. Moving horizontally was OK, he could always pull on the ground behind him. But if he started falling with nothing overhead, or if the only objects were too far away, he wouldn't be able to slow himself down.

Moto managed to pull himself back to the stone surface of the wall, running straight down the opposite side as he pulled behind him. He dropped the last ten feet, landing in a crouch. 

He had managed to pass many of the stragglers still climbing the wall, but a number of kids already well across the pit. Moto saw Keta as he landed on the opposite side of the ravine and ran towards the woods. A blast of wind shot from the trees, aiming to knock Keta backwards into the ravine, but the shapeling rolled to the side easily, laughing. 

Moto ran forward, focusing back on the path in front of him. Moto reached the edge and jumped, pulling against a pillar in front of him. At the peak of his swing he released the pillar and immediately grabbed onto another. No time to fly through the air freely. The ravine was where his ability shined above everyone else. He needed to make up a lot of time here.

The wooden columns whipped past Moto in a blur. He moved on instinct, his body remembering the twists and timings after countless hours of practice. A few kids tried to disrupt his path, but he streaked past them so fast they couldn't track him. Moto straightened out his forward momentum. He needed to hit the gate perfectly for this to work. As he approached the opposite edge, Moto let himself drop deeper into the ravine.

Towards the bottom of the pit there were two wooden beams crossed in a large 'X'. Traveling at the right angle, there was a relatively unobstructed path up and out. At the speed Moto was traveling, he couldn't really pull on anything head on for fear of slamming into it. But the crossed beams offered a perfect opportunity.

Moto grabbed onto both beams and pulled as hard as he could. He pushed his feet out in front of him, traveling like a knife through the air. He was moving so fast, even the slightest bit of extra wind resistance would send him crashing into one of the pillars. Moto felt like his head was going to explode with all the blood pressed to the top of his body by the acceleration.

He passed through the gate, releasing the pillars as he shot upwards. He squeezed his eyes shut. He wouldn't be able to respond to anything in time anyways. At least if he messed up he would smoosh very quickly.

Moto heard a kid scream in surprise as he passed by them. Their cry weirdly distorted by the speed with which he traveled. He felt himself begin to slow and snapped his eyes open.

His goal had been to come out of the ravine fast enough to enter the forest directly, not wasting any time covering the ground between. He had never practiced the move at full force, not wanting to tip his hand to the other kids. That was probably a mistake.

Moto soared through the air, his clothes snapping against his body. He travelled so fast, his neck stung where his ear lobes whipped against it. The good news was that he was definitely going to make it to the tree line. But he was also a good six stories up, careening towards the center of the thick forest with no way to slow himself down.

Moto began to fall.

He forced himself to think. He would survive the landing or he wouldn't. He could only try to increase his odds. He would have to overcome this kind of danger sooner or later to achieve his goals.

He had two problems. He was moving too fast down and too fast forward. Either momentum would probably be deadly on impact. Right now he didn't have any way to slow down in either direction. Once he got into the trees he would have anchors, but the forest couldn't be more than 30 feet tall. He wasn't going to have much time.

Pulling straight up might stop him the fastest, but he wasn't sure his body could take so much force at once.

Moto crossed his arms against his face as he crashed through the tree line. He felt a biting sting as deep gashes were cut across his forearms. He immediately began to pull.

He didn't pull straight up, instead aiming above and in front. It would be softer on his body if he gave the downward momentum somewhere to go, converting it to forward momentum in a hard swing. Of course, then he'd be moving even faster forwards. One problem at a time.

Moto pulled on the trees in front of him, clenching his jaw against the acceleration. It felt like his bones were being pulverized. He could hear the tree limbs groaning as they bent towards him, absorbing the force of his fall.

It was a narrow thing. One of Moto's feet skipped along the river that ran through the woods, nearly sending him into a chaotic midair spin. Thankfully he saw it coming and counterbalanced by pulling on a tree in the other direction. Eventually he began to rise off the ground.

Moto wanted to pull on the trees behind, slowing his momentum. But at the speed he was moving, it took all his focus just to pull himself out of the way of onrushing tree trunks or to counterbalance as he was slapped by stray branches. His clothes were covered in bloody rips from the glancing collisions.

The forest began to brighten as Moto ripped through the trees. He could see daylight, the end of the forest. Which meant the end of any anchors to slow himself down. Moto angled himself towards an opening in the trees as best he could and turned his attention towards pulling behind himself. He'd just have to hope his aim was good.

Moto pulled softly at first, thinking to protect his body. But his momentum was so great that he hardly slowed at all. He pulled with increasing force until he was straining with all his strength. He felt several branches snap behind him as he burst from the tree line. 

Moto continued to pull against the forest behind him, but the further away he got, the less force he could exert. He was still moving too fast. He needed a new plan.

He looked at the field around him. It was empty, save for Fumi sprinting towards the tall buildings ahead of them. Keta was either still behind, or he had already made his way into the towers ahead. There was only one thing Moto could think to do. Moto released the nearly-useless anchor behind himself and pulled desperately towards Fumi.

As he screamed through the air towards her, Moto managed to yell a word of warning. Fumi turned, her eyes widening in surprise. She planted her foot and made to jump out of the way, but Moto dropped his hold on the ground and grabbed onto her directly. She wasn't braced against it, so she lifted in the air towards him.

Seeing she was trapped, Fumi brought her hands together in front of her, shooting a powerful column of wind in Moto's direction. Moto felt like a hammer had slammed into his chest, just as he had hoped. 

Moto's momentum slowed greatly, but his speed was such that his body pushed through the blast of wind. He collided with Fumi as she was pulled through the air towards him. They hit the ground hard and Moto's world went black.

Moto awoke in the infirmary. Unsure which part of him hurt worse. One of his legs was splinted. His arms and temple were wrapped tightly in bandages. 

He looked at the room around him and saw Fumi lying in the bed next to him. She looked better than he did, though one arm was in a sling. When she noticed him looking at her, Fumi grabbed the curtain between them with her good arm and drew it between them violently.

It was a fair reaction. He _had_ used her as a landing pad, killing any shot she had at winning an early spot on a mission. Moto took a grim satisfaction in knowing that he was at least causing the Soundstealers problems.

Moto sat in silence for a few moments, thinking back to the race. He still had a long way to go towards mastering his ability.

After a while, the door to the infirmary opened. Moto turned, hoping it was Keta coming to see him. He felt a sting of disappointment when Iruka walked through the door.

"Oh good, you're awake. I was afraid the trip would be a waste. How are you feeling?"

Moto was confused. Why was Iruka coming to check on him? Was he in trouble somehow? "I feel fine."

"Well you look like garbage." Iruka grabbed a chair from the wall, sliding it towards Moto's bed and sitting in it the wrong way forwards. She crossed her arms across the back of the chair. "Which seems to be a pattern for you."

Moto shrugged. "They can just heal me in a week."

Iruka shook her head. "You know Moto, that healing has a cost. Sure, you heal quickly. But they do it by speeding up your metabolism. You're paying with time off the end of your life."

"I don't plan on growing old anyways."

Iruka stared at the ground for a moment, her eyes distant. "You should."

"Not to be disrespectful, but why do you care? It's my choice."

Iruka let out a sharp sigh and looked back at Moto. Whatever memories had distracted her, she was back to her usual self. "Well, that's not true anymore."

"What do you mean?"

"Somehow, that self-destructive showing managed to impress some of the higher ups. They think you could have potential, assuming you don't turn yourself into a splatter against some wall beforehand.

"So _I_ was tasked with teaching you better control. Before you kill yourself. Which you _will_ do if you keep being so reckless."

Moto felt his cheeks flush with anger. "I don't need special treatment. I can take care of myself."

Iruka laughed. "Oh yeah, totally. Look at your body. Picture of health and self preservation right there. Look, I'm not happy about losing my weekends either. But until you can show a bit more control, it's extra lessons with me."

"Fine, when do we start?"

Iruka stood and walked to the corner, where she grabbed a pair crutches. "Glad you asked. Now." 

Moto looked at his badly damaged body. "Don't you think I'm not in the best shape for this?"

The corner of Iruka's mouth twisted upwards in a wry smile. "If you're determined to break your body every chance you get, you can deal with the consequences. Besides, the pain will be a good motivator not to mess up." She thrust the crutches towards him. "Get up. Let's go."
