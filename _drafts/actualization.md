# Training
Moto raced towards the wall, jockeying for position amongst the other students. No one wanted to be last. As usual, Keta was first.

The long-limbed shapeling ran ahead of the pack with steam trailing off his body like a cape flapping in the wind. He reached the base of the wall 20 feet ahead of the others, moving with a speed even the other flame-eaters couldn't match. He tensed his legs and jumped nearly twenty feet in the air. Keta planted his foot and pushed off again, continuing upwards.

The momentum from his push brought him away from the wall, but Keta snapped his arm forward, letting the bright yellow silks wrapped around his wrist shoot towards a post at the top of the wall. The silk wrapped tight and Keta used the anchor to hurl himself over. Just like that, he was out of sight.

Moto shouldered another student out of the way and reached for his bond with the mountain. A peculiar sense of weight entered his hands, tugging on everything around him. Moto focused the energy in front of him, pulling on the wall. His body lurched forwards, the added speed giving him some breathing room from the rest of the pack. He reached the wall and jumped.

Unlike Keta, Moto jumped a normal human amount. As he approached the wall, Moto brought his knees to his chest, focusing gravity into his legs. He landed feet first and began running up the vertical stone.

The movement was awkward. To keep himself from falling, he had to pull hard against the wall, which made it difficult to lift his feet. The weight of his upper body pulled him backwards. Several kids passed him, shooting jets of flame behind to propel them. Moto saw Fumi clear the wall in a single gust-powered leap.

Moto cursed under his breath and pulled on the top of the wall. At this distance the force was weak, but it was enough to lessen the downward pressure and allow him to move at a jog rather than a walk. He crested the top of the wall in time to see the wave of students who had passed him as they approached the next obstacle.

A 50 foot wide ravine had been carved into the landscape of the Playground. Moto was still amazed at how quickly the master Daggers could reshape the landscape of the main training facility. He knew the stone had been chosen carefully for its ease of shaping, but still. Yesterday there had been a small hill there.

Moto jumped from the wall at the same time as a couple of flame-eaters. The heat energy they pulled into their bodies supercharged their muscles, letting them take the heavy landing in stride. Whatever minor damage their muscles took, it would heal quickly thanks to their enhanced metabolisms. Moto had to settle for pulling against the top of the wall to slow his descent. 

By the time he reached the ground, Moto was only ahead of three students: two stone-eaters and the lone flood-bringer. Their powers were particularly ill-suited for the obstacle course. Moto charged forward, determined to beat more than just the losers.

He came to the edge of the ravine and looked down. It was deep, filled with large wooden beams jutting out of the walls and floor at random angles. The chasm was too wide to leap, even for wind-bringers like Fumi who could summon gusts of wind to propel her. She was midway through the cavern jumping from beam to beam. 

Moto scanned the area beneath him, plotting the fastest route to the other side. He could get a running start for his first jump, but after that he would have to rely almost entirely on his power. It would be slow going. Thankfully, it seemed like most of the students were facing similar problems.

He took a step backwards and took a running leap into the ravine, using his ability to pull on a wooden pillar further than he could otherwise reach. Moto collided, gripping tightly. He felt stupid, limbs wrapped around the beam as he shuffled to the other side of the pole in order could continue forward.

Moto managed to gain some ground on a couple of the fire-bringers. The flames they shot might offer a small speed boost, but they were nothing like the propulsion of Fumi's wind. 

Moto pulled himself over the opposite ledge of the ravine and sprinted into the woods on the other side. As he moved through the forest, he could run directly towards a trunk, pulling on it to gain speed. At the last moment he would step to the side, and begin the process with a new tree further ahead. The tight forest was ideal for his ability. He whipped past a couple of the other kids.

At the speed he was traveling, Moto almost didn't have time to react to the large bear that came leaping at him from the thick undergrowth. He pulled desperately against a nearby tree trunk, barely managing to pull himself out of range of the creature's claws. Moto caught his foot in a tree root, sending him sprawling to the ground. He hit the ground hard, skinning his right elbow and knee.

Moto slid to a stop just a few feet from a river that ran through the forest. He pulled himself to his feet, groaning and cradling his now bleeding arm. The bear charged, forcing Moto to flee. He pulled on the trees carefully this time, fast enough to outpace the bear, but keeping a more manageable pace.

Moto came bursting from the forest, hoping to make up time on the next obstacle. He came up short as he saw several students standing in a group ahead of him. They were gathered around Iruka, who was waiting for everyone to emerge from the woods. Behind him was a series of multi-story wooden buildings with steeply angled roofs still under construction.

Iruka noticed Moto and gestured. "That's enough for now. The rest of the course is under construction."

Moto blinked, the tension leaving him abruptly at the unexpected end to the competition. He counted the students standing around Iruka. Five. He'd only managed to pass one person after climbing the wall. He clenched his fists as he approached the group, his head hanging.

Fumi was talking with Keta, her long hair flying wildly as she gestured. She dropped into a crouch, then stood abruptly, shooting her hands above her head. A gust of wind spiraled around her, ruffling the clothes of everyone in the group.

"Whoops! Sorry." Fumi turned back towards Keta, jumping around with more reservation. Keta just stood with arms crossed, smiling warmly. He said listening to Fumi's stories was like watching a play put on by children. Moto was pretty sure he meant it as a complement. 

Moto felt a flash of jealousy watching Fumi bounce around without a care. Wind was the most flexible resonance, useful in almost every situation. Fumi didn't appreciate at all how lucky she was. She had probably never stopped to think about what it would be like to get a weaker resonance. She took it as a given that things would just work out in her favor.

Keta noticed Moto and raised a hand, motioning him to join. As soon as she saw him approaching, Fumi's gestures ceased. "Hey." She gave a small wave with her hand.

"Hey." Moto looked towards the buildings under construction behind Iruka.

Keta looked between them and shook his head. He placed a hand on Moto's shoulder and pulled him closer, rubbing his back for a moment. Keta looked down at the blood along Moto's arm and tsk'ed. "Always you come away bleeding. You know that is not a requirement of practice, yes?"

Moto waved a hand. "It's fine, I just tripped and skinned my elbow. What were you two talking about?"

Keta nodded towards Fumi. "This one was just telling me how she planned to beat me when we run the full course."

Fumi took the bait eagerly. "I _will_ beat you! I was just sloppy on the first obstacle. And I've got some ideas for new tricks." She smiled wickedly. 

"I can't wait to see them. Assuming, of course, that I haven't already finished the race by the time you use them. Like today." They were both smiling. Fumi seemed to enjoy the challenge posed by Keta's seeming invincibility. Keta just liked teasing.

"You just wait." Fumi and Keta clapped hands and then she walked away. She didn't bother saying bye to Moto.

Moto extricated himself from Keta's arm, turning so he could look at the shapeling while they talked. Keta wore tight black clothes emblazoned with his house, just like the rest of the students. He had protested for the first few days, insisting on wearing his vibrant red dancer's clothes. Eventually he had relented to the pressure from the master Daggers, but he still wore the bright yellow silks around his wrists in rebellion.

"I don't know why you insist on calling me over when you're talking to her."

"Ah, you two will be friends, I know it. Besides, I do not want to waste my time telling the same stories and hearing the same jokes twice talking to each of you separately. Things are boring enough with this endless practicing."

"Some of us actually need the practice, you know."

Before Keta could respond, the remaining students joined the group at last and Iruka called everyone together.

"This course is going to be our focus for the next couple weeks." The two stone-eaters and the flood-bringer, the students who had come in last, all groaned.

One of the stone-eaters spoke up. "But shouldn't we be practicing things that suit our resonance? I'm going to be a fighter, not an infiltrator."

Iruka sighed audibly. Moto still didn't understand why the man volunteered to train the new recruits. Maybe it was some sort of punishment.

"Where exactly do you think you'll be fighting? Outside the castle walls? You're going to go challenge all your targets to duels then and hope they show up?"

The boy who asked the question melted back into the crowd a bit, his face red.

"Motion is the basis for _all_ Daggers. There are plenty of Tournament Heroes and Villains who have similar powers to you. But the ability to apply those powers in unexpected places, unnoticed, and in unpredictable ways is what makes you different. Every one of your powers will change and improve the way you move through the world. This course will help you find the pattern that works with your ability.

"I want you all to spend the rest of the day practicing on your own. Starting tomorrow, you can ask me or your house for advice. But it's also important that you get in the habit of analyzing your abilities and identifying ways to improve on your own. Sometimes circumstances will change in the middle of a mission and you'll have to adapt.

"I will give you one thought to focus your initial explorations. What is the difference between Eaters and Bringers?"

Moto hid the ground with a dull thud. He slammed his fists against the ground, cursing loudly. The wall loomed above him, mocking his attempts.

"How did climbing a wall get _harder_ when I learned to control gravity."

Moto pulled against the wall with his power, bringing himself to his feet. He'd lost count of how many times he had brushed the dirt from his back. He walked away from the wall, his movements stiff, steeling himself for another attempt. He was alone. The other kids had gone back to their houses to ask for advice or moved on to other obstacles. It didn't matter.

Moto didn't feel like he had much progress to show for the last two days. He needed to work harder. Moto knelt down, placing his hands on either side of his front foot. He sprinted towards the wall again. 

As he pumped his arms, he reached out and grabbed the earth in front of him, pulling himself forward by invisible ropes of force. Each stride was twice as long as normal. When he reached the wall, he focused gravity into his feet, giving him traction. He kept pulling on the wall above, which was now in front.

What was the difference between Eaters and Bringers? On the surface, the answer was simple. Eaters could pull power into their body. Bringers could manifest the energy in the world around them. But Moto knew there was more to the question.

Eaters were durable. The energy they focused into their bodies allowed them to create and withstand massive forces. Keta could leap 20 feet in the air. The stone-eaters could drop from the wall without slowing their descent, hardening their legs to the impact. 

Bringers were fragile. Their bodies still broke normally. So they had to apply a smaller, more constant force. If Moto was careful to always be pulling against the ground in front of him, he could reach the same speed as Keta. If he could get the timing right he could clear the wall just as quickly. 

The first time, he'd used too much gravity at once, trying to stick his feet to the wall completely. It was better to hit the barrier at high speed, using the gravity just enough to give him traction as he continued upwards. 

Moto bounded up the wall easily, all awkwardness gone from his stride. He could tell he was getting better at the constant pulling. As he neared the top of the wall he pulled behind himself, slowing his run so that he would come to rest on top of the wall. He increased the gravity in his feet, compensating for the decreased momentum. This was it, he could feel it.

Moto's foot slipped along the wall. He hadn't compensated enough with the gravity in his feet. His hand slapped the smooth surface of the wall, just a few inches below the ledge. It was amazing how much he had grown to hate that ledge.

Moto pulled against the wall to slow his fall, but he let himself drop the last few feet onto his back, feeling his own inadequacy. Why had he gotten such a difficult resonance to use?

Moto hit the ground, forcing the hopeless thoughts out of his mind. He pushed himself upright. Even if he got the hardest resonance, he'd find a way. He hadn't gotten handouts in the last three years and he didn't need any now either. Moto allowed himself one last hateful glance at the top of the wall, mentally taking a sledgehammer too it.

As he looked, Iruka's head appeared over the ledge. "You're wasting your time practicing here."

"I'm making progress." Moto turned and began walking away from the wall.

"Oh yeah, the dirt all over your butt really screams progress." Iruka jumped off the wall, one hand trailing above him. His fall slowed at the last minute, allowing him to land easily. He was a stone-bringer like Moto. "Why haven't you asked for any advice?"

"I don't want advice. I need to figure it out on my own."

"Well, as much as I admire your dedication to not wasting my time, I _do_ have to stay here until you all finish practicing for the day. So maybe I could offer a tip just to speed things up?"

"I don't _need_ a tip. I already figured out your question before. The difference between Eaters and Bringers is durability. I need to apply my ability in smaller amounts more frequently. It's just taking time to master."

Iruka stroked his goatee thoughtfully. "Huh, I guess that's one way you could have taken the question. It's true enough I suppose. It's the wrong answer, though."

"What do you mean? I've clearly gotten better using that answer."

"You've gotten better at copying Keta, you mean."

"He's the best, shouldn't that be my goal?"

Iruka shook his head. "You're too focused on the areas where you think others are stronger than you. If you just try to copy Keta, he'll always have an advantage over you. You have to take a different path. Here, I'll show you."

Iruka walked around the wall, not bothering to check if Moto followed. Moto considered ignoring the man and continuing with his current training. But maybe his back could use a few minutes' break from absorbing his falls.

When they reached the other side of the wall, Iruka stopped and pointed out Fumi, who was standing a few feet back from the edge of the ravine filled with wooden beams. She had a look of concentration on her face, smiling slightly.

Moto watched as she took a running leap into the pit, blasting air behind her. She managed to travel about a fourth of the way across the chasm before she grabbed on to one of the poles. Her jump had been a little off course, though. Instead of landing square against the pillar, she was forced to reach out with one arm, just barely hooking around it. 

The awkward catch sent her swinging around the pole. But instead of waiting for the momentum to stop, Fumi threw her free hand behind her and shot another blast of wind. The force sent her rocketing around the pole. She let go at the height of the spin and went launching into the air. She didn't have much control over the move yet, but she was able to latch onto a beam almost three quarters of the way across the chasm. It was nearly twice as far as her initial jump.

Iruka laughed at Moto's dumbfounded expression. "Running up that wall for two days straight feels pretty dumb, doesn't it? You see it, now. The difference between Eaters and Bringers. For Eaters, the power comes before they move. For Bringers, the power comes _while_ they move." Iruka walked away, waving over his shoulder. "I think you can figure out the rest."
