Moto stood with the other young Daggers near the entrance to the Playground. They milled about on the raised walkway, casting anxious glances into the forested pit below. After a week of continuous training, Moto could close his eyes and picture the training grounds in excruciating detail. He scanned the forest just to be safe. The senior Daggers often reshaped the Playground with their resonances, and it would be just like Iruka to change the battlefield at the last minute.

Even now, Moto marveled a moment at the size of the building. The roof nearly vanished in the torchlight, well over a hundred feet above. The dense forest that dominated all but a few feet around the edges of the building stretched even further away than the roof, several hundred feet in each direction.

The forest was in it's usual configuration. A small lake took up the right corner closest to the entrance. Rocky pillars, like miniature mountains thrust from the vegetation at irregular intervals. The ropeways that usually crisscrossed through the air above had been removed.

Daggers stood against the walkway's railing at the edges of the building. More senior members had taken positions higher up where the view would be better. Their demeanor was quiet and serious. No townsfolk cheering along the sidelines this time. Keta and Fumi kept looking to the sparsely populated walls with disappointment.

Moto's heart lurched as his gaze found Soundstealer. The man stood out from even the other senior Daggers. Tall and muscled, hair pulled into a severe topknot, he wore loose pants and a sleeveless vest. His arms were tightly wrapped, with small bells woven into the cloth that never made a sound. He leaned against the railing several stories up, looking in Moto's direction.

Moto averted his eyes quickly, palms suddenly sweaty. Two weeks of travel from Jidoka, then back in Iga for a week, and there hadn't been any mention of the warehouse fire. Moto was starting to think it hadn't been traced to him. Or perhaps the merchant wasn't close enough to Soundstealer to share every detail of his business. But was Soundstealer looking at him? Did he know after all?

Moto jumped as Fumi clapped his shoulder, stepping up beside him and waving at her father. Soundstealer frowned and turned to one of the Zephys Daggers standing beside him.

Of course. Moto tried to slow his breathing. Just watching his daughter prepare for the exam.

Fumi dropped her hand, only hesitating for an instant before her smile returned. "He acts tough, but he's excited to watch me compete. You wait, he'll crack a smile when I win."

Fumi threw her arm around Moto's shoulder and turned him back toward Keta. She dropped her voice to a whisper. "They're watching us, just like you guessed."

Moto didn't bother looking around. He had already noticed. Hako and Hibana were leaning against the wall and chatting idly. Hako's gangly frame was a sharp contrast to Hibana's thick-corded muscle and catlike grace. Taller than most of the other recruits, with the salt-and-pepper hair of those from north of the Fox Fangs, they should have stood out more. Yet somehow they faded into the background. Haiyu, the third member of the squad, knelt as he retied his boots with thin, delicate fingers.

They were subtle, looking everywhere just like the other recruits, but their focus always returned. Watching. It seemed they had decided Moto's squad was the biggest threat. And they weren't alone.

No one was looking with the same intensity as Hako's squad, but it was hard to miss all the glances and whispers from the other recruits. Moto had expected it for Keta, who had always been out in front, but it seemed the extra missions and attention from Soundstealer and Iruka had put a target on all three of their backs.

It surprised Moto to realize that others were aware of him, keeping track of what he was doing. He looked around at the other recruits clustered in their squads and could hardly remember all of their names.

He recognized Yoku Whitefire, a tall, proud-faced woman who tossed her head like a warhorse as she moved. She was the eldest daughter of a prominent family in Ignis. And he knew the bronze glimmer in her squad, a squat man with coppery hair and eyes, was a stone-eater named Seido. But he didn't know the third member, a woman with straight, shoulder-length hair.

The fourth squad Moto didn't know at all. One was a human woman with a broad face and a flat nose. Another was a short shapeling woman with large eyes and a pinched look to her nose and mouth. Both had suspicious eyes, constantly darting between the other recruits' faces. The two flood-eaters. It made sense he didn't know them, since they had been trained separate from the others. But their third member, a stern-faced shapeling man, was just as unfamiliar.

Moto tried to convince himself that he didn't know these people because he didn't care. He'd made the conscious choice not to get close to the others so he could focus on his revenge. But after talking with Iruka and arguing with Keta, he wasn't so sure. Would he have been able to get to know everyone if he wanted? Or would his resonance have blinded him, made him myopic, no matter what he wanted?

As he looked at the other recruits, Moto grunted in surprise. "Aren't there supposed to be 13 of us? I only see 12."

Fumi looked at him with a mixture of sadness and surprise. "Joyo didn't survive his first mission. I thought you would have heard since he was a Terran."

Moto shifted uncomfortably. From his own house and he hadn't noticed at all. "I... guess I've been spending too much time training this past week. I hadn't talked with anyone from my house."

Iruka's spiky black hair was followed by gleaming glasses and a smirk as her head appeared over the edge of the walkway, climbing up from the forest below. All of the recruits went quiet and turned to face her. She was holding a sack of jingling coins that reminded Moto of the very first entrance exam.

"Miss me? Hmm?" Hand on her hip, Iruka cocked her head sideways and smiled, waiting until an awkward mumble of affirmation rose up from the recruits. She crossed her arms and donned a mocking pout at the lukewarm response. "Hardly a warm welcome for your beloved sensei."

She hefted the jingling bag and her wicked grin returned. "Well, I'm a busy lady and if you lot aren't going to shower me with appreciation, then I've got better things to do. Let's get down to business. And don't go thinking I'll make things easier on you just to regain your favor."

Iruka opened the bag and started tossing leather armbands to the kids. Each held a hand-sized medallion of smooth iron. "The rules are pretty simple. Each recruit gets an armband. On the back side of these medallions is a unique number. Each squad's numbers add up to zero. Make it up to the walkway with a positive number and your squad advances to the one-on-one combats."

She paused for a second to let the recruits process. Moto thought she shot him a nervous glance before her next words. "You can split from your squad if you want, but there's no joining back up after that. There's a max of eight spots in the next round, so be quick about it rockheads. Your pairings will be determined by the average score for your squad, so getting a higher number will make the next round easier. Any questions?"

Iruka rolled her eyes theatrically as Hako's hand went up. Moto remembered a similar interaction at the entrance exam. He still had the same innocent, earnest look about him, but somehow it didn't seem quite as immature this time. Maybe it was the growth spurt, or a new hardness in his eyes from their first mission, but Iruka didn't complain. Audibly at least.

"If all we need is a positive number, why can't we just throw away our negative coins and be done?"

The fact that it was a reasonable question only seemed to make things worse, though Moto wasn't sure if it was because she couldn't give Hako a hard time, or because it meant she had to spend more time giving instructions. "The only way to get rid of a coin is to have it taken from you. Any other way, and it still counts towards your score. And once you take a coin, it's yours until someone takes it from you. No forcing other recruits to show you their coin before you take it. Anything _else_?"

With no further questions, Iruka finished handing out the armbands in silence. When she got to Moto, she looked into his eyes as she handed him the band, searching for something. She gave a small nod and carried on.

Moto's squad was starting in the far left corner of the Playground. As they walked, they pulled the medallions from their casings and looked at the numbers. Fumi had a three and Keta had a negative five. Moto had a two. Was that why Iruka had given him those looks? Was she afraid he would split from the group because he had a positive number?

Moto rolled his shoulders in frustration. Just because he was pragmatic and made sacrifices, didn't mean he _wanted_ to abandon his friends. People acted like a willingness to do bad things when they were necessary meant you must be a jerk in every part of your life. He still wanted to do good things when he could. To have friends and a happy life. When he could.

He put the medallion back into place. He would do his best to help the squad. But a small voice at the back of his mind asked what would he do if things went wrong?

As they walked, Moto realized that Fumi and Keta were staring at him expectantly. "What?"

Fumi shrugged. "Just waiting for the plan."

Keta nodded. "We follow your lead." His smile was only barely tinged with uncertainty. The two of them hadn't talked about Soundstealer since they left Jidoka. There were certainly more arguments to be had if they wanted to work together. But both of them were enjoying the good humor. Moto would try his best to hear Keta out when they finally did talk again.

"Woah, woah. I didn't say leader! He's the plan guy. The wind hasn't blown one way or the other on who's the leader yet."

Moto smiled. Ignoring practicality for an instant, he _wished_ Keta's plan for Soundstealer would work. "How about a bet?"

Fumi arched an eyebrow.

"Whoever wins the tournament is squad leader."

Fumi clapped and a burst of wind ruffled everyone's clothes in her enthusiasm. "You're on!"

Keta sniffed, inspecting his nails theatrically. "You know, if you want me to be the leader that badly, you could just ask. There's no need to wait for the inevitable."

Moto pushed him and the squad laughed. None of them even considered the odds that the winner might not be one of them.

As they neared the far corner, Moto pulled himself back to the task at hand. He stroked his chin as he thought out loud. "We have to be careful about the negative coins. Since every squad adds up to zero, we can't just attack head on and take them all. We have to be selective. But if we choose wrong, it's even worse. This round is going to be about intelligence gathering more than anything else.

"If the other squads are smart, once the tournament starts they won't discuss their medallions. If they do, we should assume it's meant to deceive us. The real truth will be in how they fight."

Keta nodded. "That is where the real truth always lies."

"Ideally, we would watch two squads fight and make some deductions from how they engage." Fumi and Keta both frowned. Moto had figured they wouldn't like sitting on the sidelines. "But realistically we won't have that luxury. So we'll have to be watching our enemies closely as we fight. Who's reckless? Who do they protect? If we can, we should disengage and strike a few times in different configurations so we can spot patterns in how they move."

"Won't we be giving away the same information?"

Moto thought for a second. "We could try to bluff, coming up with a formation that looks like we're protecting Keta even though I have a negative coin." Moto remembered Iruka's warnings from their very first sparring session. People were more predictable in combat than they thought. "But we haven't had much time to practice anything like that. We'd probably give up the lie subconsciously. We'd put the positive coins at risk and waste some of our focus on maintaining the bluff for a questionable advantage. I think it would be more useful to focus on offense."

They had reached the starting point, a small clearing in the woods at the base of one of the small mountains. Fumi pulled her wild hair back into a bun as she responded. "If we're going to fight like normal, maybe you and I should swap coins, Moto. Iruka never said we couldn't take each other's. And you'll be the furthest back."

It was an obvious idea, once she suggested it. But Moto had been focused on the arrangement of coins as they were originally given, he hadn't thought about swapping. Just an oversight, or his resonance again? Now that he was looking, it felt like there was room for doubt everywhere. "That's a good idea."

Fumi beamed as she handed him her three coin and took his two. Keta had a foot planted on the mountain beside them, leaning forward in a deep stretch. A loud gong signaled the start of the exam.

<br />

<br />
<br />

They moved through the woods in silence, darting from one rough-barked pine tree to the next, lingering in the heavy pools of shadow cast by the branches. Moto crouched low, keeping his head beneath the thick underbrush as he quested out with his gravity sense.

It was difficult to sift through all the weights he felt. The Playground was densely forested, with tree trunks, underbrush, and lichen-covered boulders so closely packed you couldn't see more than 20 feet in any direction. But if they paused for a few breaths he could tell movement from the the stationary vegetation. So far nothing stirred.

Fumi was crouched out of sight ten feet away and Keta rested in the trees above. Close, but not so close they could all be hit at once. Moto reached out and tugged at them once, lightly. The signal for all clear.

Moto rose, his muscles tensed to dart forward, when a sudden weight crept into the edge of his gravity sense, 30 feet out. He reached back to Keta and Fumi, tugging sharply to bring them to a halt. He dropped flat in the underbrush, knowing they were doing the same.

Three weights, arrayed a few strides apart, approached slowly. Moto strained his eyes and ears, but even knowing where they were, he couldn't detect a thing. Hiding in the shadows, making sure to keep to the moss-laden patches that deadened the sound of footsteps. If it weren't for his gravity sense, they would have been undetectable. Fighting Daggers was completely different than the thugs they had faced on their missions.

Moto was tempted to raise his sense off the forest floor to get a sense for who was approaching. But even a pull as light as his sense would probably be felt on most of the body. He kept it down around the feet.

As the party approached, Moto pulled on Keta and Fumi, signaling the locations. Three pulls, three enemies. Right shoulder, approaching from north west. A long pull, hold. Moto couldn't help but smile, amazed that he had ever been jealous of Fumi's resonance.

Moto finally caught sight of one of them. Her large, muscular frame stalked through the underbrush like a panther. Hibana. Hako's squad must have made straight for their starting corner.

Hako and Haiyu appeared from the underbrush and regrouped around Hibana. As they communicated with hand signs, Hako and Haiyu took the outside flanks, leaving Hibana with her back to a tree. Protecting her, or just a coincidence? Keta said she was another flame-eater like him, so Moto would guess that her natural position was always on the front line. He filed the observation away.

On their current route, the enemy squad was going to pass right by Fumi. Moto figured she had probably seen them by now, but he signaled just to be safe. Then he told her and Keta to be ready. Communication done, Hako's squad spread out again, keeping Hibana at center position.

As they passed Fumi, Moto reached past them by several paces. He grabbed hold of a branch, careful to choose one with a clear line of sight so he didn't pull on any intervening plants as well, then pulled. It was the barest whisper. Just enough to hint at unseen assassins leaping through the trees. A loud crack would have been obvious.

Hako's squad reacted instantly, pulling tight around Hibana. Definitely protection. Hako spread his hands wide, shooting a cloud of ice needles toward the sound. Hibana crouched, getting ready to move. Haiyu stood with his back to both of them, watching the rear. Their movements were precise and disciplined, as though they had been working together for years.

A swirling sphere of wind erupted from Fumi's hiding spot, pushing a front of dust and debris towards Haiyu. At the same time, Fumi launched sideways, planting a foot against a tree trunk and throwing herself towards Haiyu from an unexpected angle. The boy coughed, raising slender arms to cover his face from the dust.

Fumi connected, bringing her heel down against the boy's shoulder. Haiyu hardly flinched, sending a blind fist in Fumi's direction. She crossed her arms and a cushion of air blossomed before her, absorbing most of the blow. The impact sent her sprawling backwards, though she caught herself with a tight flip in the air, landing in a crouch.

Keta dropped from the trees between Haiyu and Hibana, sending a flurry of jabs into the slight boy's ribs before spinning, aiming a kick at Hibana's head. The jabs should have left Haiyu gasping for breath, but he merely grunted. His hardened stone-eater body eating the blows. Hibana caught Keta's foot, muscles in her arms flaring much like the shapeling's.

Hibana pivoted, lifting Keta into the air as Hako sent a fist of water towards his chest. The water scattered around the rock that Moto hurled in its path at the same time Keta unfurled the weighted silks around his arm and sent them cracking into Hibana's wrist, forcing her to drop him.

Hibana's wrist hung at a bad angle as Keta leapt back. She took a deep breath and her wrist popped back into place. The two squads faced off, Hako's standing back to back as Moto and the others circled a few paces out.

Moto used the moment's pause to analyze what he had just seen. Hibana was definitely holding back. The center was no place for a flame-eater, and she hadn't made a move until she was directly attacked by Keta. When the ambush began, it looked like she was getting ready to evade, not leap into the fray. Either she had a positive coin or that's what they wanted people to think.

Moto thought they were smart enough to think of switching coins. So why would they choose an arrangement that hampered one of their members so dramatically?

Hako's squad seemed careful. Even now they were watching and waiting, rather than striking out to get free. Maybe that meant they wouldn't mind taking a hit to their offense in order to leave their biggest positive coin in the hands of the fastest reflexes. But still, it seemed like too big a sacrifice.

Unless that was the point. Hibana's position was so obviously suboptimal, it couldn't help but draw attention. Moto thought back to the way Hako's squad observed them during training. Each one looking at someone different, thinking no one would notice. They were smart, but they didn't seem to put much stock in the intelligence of others. Exactly the kind of mindset that would lay a trap and make the bait obvious.

Moto grabbed a stone the size of his head from ten feet back and accelerated it towards Haiyu. Taking his cue, Keta and Fumi raced forward, aiming for Hibana. They had noticed her strange position as well.

Hako stepped back with his arms out to the side. He brought them together and two walls of ice traced the path of his hands, protecting Hibana on either side. Haiyu stepped forward and punched the stone flying through the air, his hardened fist cracking the rock into a thousand bits of debris.

The slender stone-eater closed his eyes against the shrapnel. Just like with Fumi, the boy didn't protect his visibility, trusting in his heightened durability. Moto grabbed the trees behind Haiyu and pulled, hurtling himself towards the boy.

Moto brought his feet up, slamming into Haiyu's chest at high speed. The boy staggered a step, but it felt to Moto like drop kicking a stone pillar. The impact sent a jarring shock into his ankles and knees.

Haiyu brought both hands down in a blind hammer fist, but Moto was ready. Keeping his feet planted on Haiyu, Moto pulled against the surrounding trees to pivot around the boy and dodge the strike. He reached past the stone-eater and grabbed Hibana with his power, pulling as hard as he could. Moto's legs flexed against Haiyu's immovable frame as Hibana was yanked backwards bodily, crashing into her ally.

Moto let the gravity fall from his feet and dropped to the ground, sliding past Haiyu towards Hibana. The boy's vision had returned, and Moto made sure the stone-eater was watching before his hands snapped forward, reaching for Hibana's band. The boy staggered backwards.

That was the last confirmation Moto needed. Hibana was a flame-eater, she should have been able to react before Moto swung around to her. And twice now Haiyu had chosen to defend himself over Hibana. Iruka was right, people were predictable during combat.

Moto pulled from his palm against Haiyu, the boy's weight causing Moto's hand to change directions rapidly. Haiyu blinked in surprise as Moto's hand jumped to the latch at his armband and pulled it free.

Moto tugged against the tree behind him, pulling himself clear. Keta and Fumi were still engaged with the other two. Keta had broken through Hako's ice wall and Fumi had thrown herself over the top of it with a blast of wind to reach Hibana.

Moto pulled the silver medallion free to check the number and his stomach tightened. Negative four.

Moto cursed as he realized his mistake. Iruka said each coin was unique. With a negative four, the only way two positive coins could balance it out is a one and a three. But Moto had the three coin. Hako's squad had to have two negative coins.

Their actions suddenly clicked into place. The way Hako kept falling back to Hibana. He wasn't defending her. She was watching his back. While Haiyu served as a decoy that also made it seem like Hibana was at the center.

When he saw Moto with the coin, Hako smiled. It didn't last long as he struggled to keep Keta away. Clever as their plan was, Hako's squad was outmatched in terms of battle reflexes. But Haiyu and Hibana were regrouping on Hako. They were getting ready to flee.

Moto cursed again, more violently this time. "They had two negative coins. Go for Hako!" He wouldn't let them get away. Hako wasn't going to best him. Moto grabbed the trees ahead and shot like an arrow, flying past the Hibana and Haiyu as he closed on Hako.

Moto's only warning was the sound of cracking stone before it felt like someone slammed a fully loaded cart into his chest. He lurched sideways, and slammed into a tree, breaking through a branch the width of his wrist. There was a sharp pain in his side as several ribs cracked.

Moto scrambled to recover, his side white hot agony and his breath coming short. He barely managed to get his feet under him before Hibana was on him, gripping his shoulders with her hands as she pulled him in for a head butt. Her eyes were cold and lethal.

With her speed and strength, Moto knew he couldn't stop her. He flared his resonance and pulled against the ground as hard as he could. Hibana's eyes widened marginally, surprised as he slipped free of her grasp. But the pull was so hard it slammed Moto against the ground. The pain in his ribs took his breath away.

Hibana pivoted smoothly, pulling her fist up for another strike, but a blast of wind pushed her back against a tree and gave Moto enough time to pull clear.

By the time Moto regained his feet, Hako had almost disappeared into the woods, with Haiyu standing at the edge of the clearing guarding his escape. Fumi and Keta stood between Haiyu and Hibana, Fumi with her hands outstretched as she held Hibana at bay with her wind. His teammates were reluctant to chase after Hako with Hibana attacking him.

For the third time, Moto cursed. Only Hako planned to run. The other two only feigned retreat to bring his guard down. The minute he turned his back to Hibana, she had changed gears. The sudden shift to offense gave them the upper hand and was going to let Hako get away.

They couldn't let that happen. Moto was in no shape to go sneaking through the woods, let alone to fight another squad. If they retreated and tried to find another target, they would be at a huge disadvantage. And that's assuming they could even find another group before the contest was already over.

He couldn't catch up to Hako in his condition. But if he could hold Hibana and Haiyu here, maybe Fumi and Keta could overtake him. Moto wiped blood from the side of his mouth and squared his stance. "You two go after Hako, I'll hold these two here."

Fumi looked concerned. "But you're--."

"Go! We don't have time to debate, this is our best shot."

She nodded reluctantly dropping her wind blast as she and Keta turned to follow Hako.

As soon as the wind dropped, Hibana's legs flared and she launched herself toward Fumi. This time, Moto was ready. He dove to the side of Hibana and pulled. He couldn't halt her momentum, but he could throw her off course. Her leapt went wide of Fumi, sending her crashing into the woods.

Hibana adapted quickly, refocusing on Moto. It seemed that if Moto was going to get in her way, she had no qualms taking him out first. The ice in her eyes suggested she didn't mind either way if he was still breathing at the end of it.

Moto pulled himself out of her way, not letting her close the distance. She couldn't change direction after she leapt. If he could just keep dancing to the side, he could keep avoiding her.

Haiyu had thrown himself between Hako and the others. Moto had no doubt the other two could make it past, but they didn't have time to slow and deal with him. If only Moto could pull him out of their way so they could keep moving forward. But with his resonance active, Haiyu was too heavy. He needed more leverage.

Hibana threw herself at Moto, her speed increasing with her frustration at his evasion. But this time Moto didn't dodge. The minute Hibana hit, he latched on to Haiyu, pulling as hard as he could with his power.

Darkness played around the edges of Moto's vision. It felt like he was being flattened by a boulder. But he held firm. Hibana grunted, surprised that she hit him and surprised that he seemed so hard to move. Haiyu's eyes widened as he was dragged sideways.

Hibana and Moto sprawled across the forest floor. Some of their momentum had been absorbed by Haiyu, but they still had enough speed to land heavily. Expecting the impact, Moto recovered first, pulling behind him and managing to get a bit of space before Hibana regained her feet.

Moto took a step back. The anger in Hibana's eyes spoke of murder. All thoughts of slowing the others down for Hako's escape seemed to be forgotten. Moto needed to get away from her. He glanced over her shoulder. If the others had made it past, then he could turn and run.

Seeing the collision, Keta had stopped. He looked uncertainly between Hako and Hibana. Moto coughed into his hand and ignored the blood that splattered across his fingers. "Keta, go! I can stay ahead of Hibana. We need Hako's coin."

Keta turned to face Hibana, dropping into a crouch. "No."

Hako darted between a stand of trees, out of sight. "This isn't the time to be noble, that coin is too important. I'll be fine."

"I won't leave you. I don't care what the stakes are. I won't leave anyone I love again!"

Keta's muscles flared, his loose fitting pants suddenly tight around his legs. The heat from his body was so great the grass at his feat began to smoke.

Hibana realized that Keta was about to interfere. But he was nearly 20 feat away, while she was only a few steps from Moto. Her face contorted into a snarl as she leapt at Moto. Too fast to dodge.

A blast of heat buffeted Moto as Keta appeared in the air, driving his knee into Hibana's side. The woman's eyes widened. The Shapeling had covered almost four times the distance in the same time. Then she was slamming through a tree, breaking the trunk in half.

Moto didn't even see Keta's feet touch the ground before his body changed directions. He was moving so fast it seemed like his body was skipping the space between where we was and where he wanted to go.

Hibana dragged herself up just in time for Keta's axe kick to throw her back to the ground. She hit the ground so hard she bounced. Keta was behind her, catching her ragdoll form before it returned to the earth and throwing her so hard she crashed through two trees. She did not rise.

Keta was a furnace. The heat from his body created a fierce wind around him. It whipped through the trees, their branches blowing back with a low roar.

Keta turned to Fumi. "She will be back on her feet soon. Get Moto out of the forest. I will get the coin from Hako."

Hearing that, Haiyu squared himself, ready to intervene. In the blink of an eye, Keta was coiled in the air in front of him. His legs shot out like lightning, connecting with the boys chest. Haiyu crashed backwards into a tree, his feet leaving furrows in the earth from his extra weight.

Then Keta was gone into the woods.

Moto staggered, but Fumi caught him on her shoulder and hefted him back to his feet. Then she was guiding him through the woods, increasing their speed with her wind.

As they ran, Moto dropped in and out of lucidity. But he was aware enough to be frustrated with himself. He had played into Hako's traps again and again. He replayed every detail he had missed, should he have been able to spot them? Had he cost all of them their chance at being Daggers?

They made it to the edge of the Playground and Fumi set Moto up against the wall. They waited together, watching the forest as they waited for Keta. Had he found Hako? Did he retrieve the coin? With every minute that passed, Moto worried more. Hako had proven he was not to be underestimated.

Finally, after what felt like ages, Keta appeared at the edge of the woods. He raced forward, staggering twice before he made it to the raised walkway around the Playground. When he stopped in front of Moto and Fumi, his knees buckled and he thumped roughly to the ground in a sitting position. He opened his hand to show a coin with a seven on it.

Keta gave a lopsided smile to Moto, his usual grace gone in his tired state. "You see? Sometimes we can have it all." Then he slumped sideways, giving way to his exhaustion. The shapeling was unconscious before his shoulder hit the ground.
