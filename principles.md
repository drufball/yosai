The stories I write take inspiration from some of my favorite parts of Japanese culture. This page codifies
those inspirations, and how I expect them to impact my stories.

# Anime
- **The hero is special.** Give them frequent opportunities to surprise and impress. Bonus points if they can give powerful people their comeuppance. 
- **Concrete, visible power levels.** Power levels are explicit. They're often shown by bounties, tournament rankings, etc. Characters are given frequent opportunities to compete against one another and show their relative power levels. 
- **Rivals and the competition lead the conflict.** Characters are often focused on overcoming rivals and reaching new levels on the power ranking. Villains sneak up on you, rather than being explicit from the start.
- **Sudden transformations.** Mid-battle transformations/realizations turn a loss into a decisive victory. Time skips and other off-camera training create exciting leaps in character proficiency. 

# Pokemon
- **Embrace the random encounter.** Unexpected opportunities for allies, training, and powerups. 
- **Craft your party.** Training is part of the adventure.

## Japan
- **Fueled by nostalgia.** World details, organizations, adventure ideas, etc. are pulled from iconic childhood memories:
	- Pokemon
	- Power Rangers
	- Godzilla
	- Samurai
	- Ninja
- **Showcase the weird, unexpected.** Showcase the ways that Japanese culture and medieval fantasy differs from Western stereotypes.
- **Zen beauty.** Highlight the beauty of the Japanese aesthetic.
